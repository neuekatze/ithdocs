<p align="justify" class="style27"><br />
  Syntax refers to the rules for sequencing the order of words 
  within a phrase or sentence, including rules permitting more than one possible 
  sequential ordering of words. To understand the following discussion of Ithkuil 
  syntax it is necessary to have a cursory understanding of the notions of <em>semantic 
    role</em>, <em>pragmatic role</em>, and <em>grammatical</em> (or <em>syntactical</em>) <em>relations</em>:</p>
<div align="justify" class="style27">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Semantic role</strong>: This refers to the underlying semantic 
      function of a particular word, irrespective of overt morphological category. 
      We have already seen how Ithkuil marks its noun cases to reflect semantic 
      roles, not grammatical relations. Such roles include Agent, Patient, Experiencer, 
      Recipient, Instrument, etc., as previously explained in <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o1">Section 
    4.1</a> et seq.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Pragmatic role</strong>: This refers to the function of a word 
      or phrase in relation to its predicate or the rest of the sentence in terms 
      of whether and how it represents &#8220;given&#8221; versus &#8220;new&#8221; 
      information, i.e., whether or not the word or phrase represents background 
      information already known to the addressee, or whether it represents new 
      information previously unknown to the addressee. Three such roles or relations 
      are generally delineated: <strong>topic,</strong> <strong>comment</strong>, 
      and <strong>focus</strong>. The <em>topic</em> of a sentence is the word 
      or phrase about which the speaker has been asked or is expected by the addressee 
      to talk about. The <em>comment</em> is the information (usually a predicate) 
      given by the speaker about the particular topic. The term <em>focus</em> refers to whatever information in a sentence is new to the addressee, (i.e., 
      not previously known).  To illustrate these concepts, consider the sentence <em>I can see 
          why Mary&#8217;s angry, but what about Bill?</em> (i.e., <em>What happened 
            to make Bill angry, too?</em>). In the hypothetical answer <em>Bill (or 
              He) is angry because he lost his keys</em>, &#8216;Bill&#8217; (or &#8216;he&#8217;) 
      is the topic, &#8216;is angry because he lost his keys&#8217; is the comment, 
      and &#8216;he lost his keys&#8217; is the focus.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Grammatical </strong>(or<strong> syntactical</strong>)<strong> relations</strong>: the arbitrary word-ordering rules of a language, irrespective 
      of semantic or pragmatic roles, e.g., the subject of the sentence in English 
      normally precedes the main verb and the direct object normally follows the 
      main verb.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="justify" class="style27">In general, the syntax of a language either (1) establishes 
  the permissible grammatical relations of the language, (2) reflects and/or reinforces 
  semantic roles, (3) reflects and/or reinforces pragmatic roles, or (4) any combination 
  of these. As one might surmise from the above, English syntax is weighted heavily 
  toward establishing grammatical relations at the near-total expense of identifying 
  semantic roles. As for pragmatic roles, English rarely reflects these in its 
  syntax (one exception is the strong tendency for placing <em>wh</em>- question 
  words in sentence-initial position in specialized questions, even if they represent 
  a direct object, e.g., <em>What have you done?</em> or <em>Who[m] are they talking 
    about?</em>), however, such roles do tend to be marked &#8220;supra-segmentally&#8221; 
  by inflection of vocal pitch and tone of voice. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">We have already seen the extreme to which Ithkuil uses noun cases to mark semantic 
  roles morphologically as opposed to syntactically. And since grammatial relations 
  in and of themselves are relatively arbitrary within language, Ithkuil uses 
   word order primarily to accomplish pragmatic relations, i.e., to indicate the topic and/or focus of a sentence. Additionally, Ithkuil does have a few word order constraints  necessary to ensure avoidance 
  of ambiguity in determining which  
  nouns lie in apposition to their head, and which words of a compound sentence 
  lie within a case-frame as opposed to outside the case-frame. The specifics of Ithkuil word order are explained in Section 9.1 below.</p>

</table>
<p align="justify" class="style27">The concept of semantic focus refers to what 
  information in an utterance is to be considered new information, while the semantic topic is the
  background context already known or implied. The specifics are explained below and are best understood 
through various English illustrations.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">In any given discourse (i.e., a contextual series of utterances 
  such as a conversation, a story, an account of an event, etc.), any single sentence 
  of that discourse will likely make reference to previously mentioned material 
  as background, as well as present new material to further the purpose of the 
  discourse. Semantic focus refers to those elements of a sentence which constitute 
  new material within an actual or implied discourse. For example, the sentence <em>My dog jumps through hoops</em> could function as an answer to several different 
  questions such as 1) <em>What tricks can your dog do?</em>, or 2) <em>Does your 
    dog do anything with hoops? </em>or 3) <em>Do you know of anyone&#8217;s pet 
      that jumps through hoops?</em> or even 4) <em>What&#8217;s up with you?</em> In answering the first of these questions, &#8216;jump through hoops&#8217; 
  would have semantic focus while the dog is background material, i.e. the topic. In answering 
  the second question, the verbal phrase &#8216;jump through&#8217; would have 
  focus while both the dog and the hoops would be the topic. In answering 
  the third question, it would be &#8216;my dog&#8217; that carries the focus 
  while jumping through hoops would be the topic. Lastly, in answering the 
  fourth sentence, no element in the sentence has focus over any other, as all 
  elements present previously unknown material within the context of the discourse. 
  In general, English conveys focus by a shift in vocal inflection (tone and pitch 
  contours) to provide emphasis.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Focus does not necessarily require a full discourse to have 
  semantic relevance; it can occur within a single autonomous sentence, in which 
  case the background discourse is implied. For example, a person might spontaneously 
  begin a conversation with the same sentence: <em>My dog jumps through hoops.</em> In 
  English, the speaker might use vocal inflection to emphasize what elements convey 
  semantic focus versus what elements are to be taken by the listener as &#8220;given.&#8221; 
  Or, the speaker might say the sentence in a neutral tone of voice, essentially 
  inviting the listener to &#8220;choose&#8221; which elements to focus upon in 
  responding, e.g., <em>Oh, you have a dog?</em> or <em>Oh, does he do any other 
    tricks? </em>or <em>Oh, do you use metal or plastic hoops?</em> or an equally 
  neutral response such as <em>Oh, you don&#8217;t say?</em></p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Ithkuil uses word-order to  accomplish the same options 
  that such vocal inflections accomplish in English. In Ithkuil, the element with focus is placed immediately before the verb.  As for the topic of the sentence, this is shown by placing it as the first element in a sentence. If there is no overt topic or focus, the verb will appear as the first word in the sentence.

<h3 align="justify" class="style27">9.1.1 Abbreviated Sentences Using Focus and Topicalization</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Focus and topicalization allow Ithkuil, as with other languages, 
  to provide abbreviated sentences in direct answer to commands,  questions, 
  or to comment on a topic already under discussion. Because the topic is already 
  known within the contextual discourse, only the portion of the new sentence 
  carrying semantic focus need be spoken. Similarly, the <a href="07_suffixes.html#Sec7o4o13">topicalization 
    suffix</a> in conjunction with the <a href="05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o3o3">INTERROGATIVE</a> illocution, allows for abbreviated inquiries within a known contextual 
  discourse, similar to such abbreviated sentences in English, e.g., &#8216;and 
  Bill?&#8217; in lieu of the full sentence &#8216;Comment on how this applies 
  to Bill.&#8217;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27">9.1.2 Word-order within Case-Frames</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Within a case-frame (see <a href="05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o4">Section 
  5.4</a>), the verb always appears in initial position to identify the clause 
  as a case frame (using <a href="05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o4o1">FRAMED Relation</a> in the verb). Because of this, it becomes necessary to utilize the focusing and sequencing affixes from Sec. 7.4.13 to identify elements which carry focus or are topicalized within the case-frame. Additionally, the last noun within the case-frame 
  will usually take the -<strong>Vt&#8217;</strong> in degree 2, 6, 7, or 9 (see <a href="07_suffixes.html#Sec7o4o13">Sec. 7.4.13</a>) 
  to signify the end of the case-frame, unless this is clear without the suffix 
  (e.g., because the case-frame is in sentence-final position). </p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27">9.1.3 Additional Constraints in Word Order</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">The following additional word-order constraints exist 
  in order to avoid potential ambiguity or semantic incoherence.</p>
<ul class="style27">
  <li>
    <div align="justify">Nouns in Possessive and Associative cases (see <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o4">Secs. 
      4.4</a> and <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o5">4.5</a>) 
      which are dependent on, or in apposition to a &#8220;head&#8221; noun, must 
      immediately precede or follow that head noun, unless the relationship between the two nouns is otherwise clear from context or other morphological elements.<br />
      <br />
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">A case-frame cannot be broken apart into segments within a main sentence, 
      i.e., the case-frame must constitute a single cohesive clause and not contain 
      elements of the main clause within it. It is possible to &#8220;nest&#8221; 
      a second case-frame within a case-frame, similar to the way in which subordinate 
      or relative clauses can be nested in English and other Western languages, 
      e.g., <em>[Despite owning a Picasso [that comes from his Blue period] [of 
        which I, [a mere student,] am fond,]] Joe is actually a very humble person</em>.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27"> 9.1.4 Phonotactically-Induced Syntactic Modifications </h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">As mentioned above, word-order can shift in an Ithkuil sentence 
  to accommodate phonotactic or phonaesthetic ends, i.e., for purposes of euphony. 
  This is because suffixes on a formative, as well as morphemes associated with 
  categories of Aspect and Bias can be moved to verbal adjuncts or transformed into autonomous adjuncts (see Sections <a href="06_verbs_2.html#Sec6o3">6.3</a>, <a href="08_adjuncts.html#Sec8o2">8.2</a>, <a href="08_adjuncts.html#Sec8o3">8.3</a>, and <a href="08_adjuncts.html#Sec8o4">8.4</a>). As 
   words 
  of six syllables or more are generally undesirable,  any formative 
  with numerous affixes is potentially subject to having several of its morphemes 
  redistributed to adjuncts. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Example: </p>
<blockquote class="style27">
  <p align="justify"><strong><img src="/images/5-10-33c.jpg" width="133" height="46" /><br />

If only the physician wouldn&rsquo;t  eat his food in one gulp like that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style27">When ordering such phonaesthetically-induced adjuncts, it is 
  important that they can be easily associated with the formative to which they 
  apply. Generally, this means that they will be adjacent to the formative, or 
  occur on either side of other adjuncts associated with the formative.</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27"><br />
  9.1.5 Iconicity </h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">English and other languages generally display phrase-structure 
  patterns and word-order patterns which reinforce, or even reflect, a cognitive 
  understanding of what is being described, i.e., the order of the words themselves 
  reflects information about how we are to understand the utterance. Such a phenomenon 
  is known as <strong>iconicity</strong>. In English and other Western languages, 
  the most common way in which iconicity is manifested is what is termed &#8220;sequential 
  order iconicity,&#8221; the idea that the actual sequential order of words in 
  a phrase or sentence reflects the sequential order of the events they describe. 
  For example, the phrases &#8216;eye it, try it, buy it,&#8217; &#8216;I came, 
  I saw, I conquered,&#8217; or &#8216;dine and dash&#8217; describe sequential 
  events where the sequence of the words reflect the sequence of the events. What 
  is most important is that re-ordering of the words either changes the meaning 
  of the phrase or leads to semantic nonsense, e.g., &#8216;buy it, eye it, try 
  it&#8217; implies that a different sequence of events actually takes place than 
  &#8216;eye it, try it, buy it.&#8217; This can be more dramatically illustrated 
  with the following pair of sentences.</p>
<blockquote class="style27">
  <p align="justify">1) <em>Jane got married and had a baby.</em><br />
    2) <em>Jane had a baby and got married.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style27">In English, the ambiguous word &#8216;and&#8217; is interpreted 
  as connecting a sequence of events, i.e., &#8216;and&#8217; is interpreted to 
  mean sequential &#8216;then&#8217; (= &#8216;and following that,&#8217; &#8216;then 
  next&#8217; or &#8216;then later&#8217;). As a result, the meanings of the two 
  sentences imply very different social interpretations about Jane.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Besides the reflection of sequential order, other types of 
  word-order iconicity are possible. For example, compare the subtle difference 
  in meaning between the following two sentences:</p>
<blockquote class="style27">
  <p align="justify">3) <em>Sam painted the fence white.</em><br />
    4) <em>Sam painted the white fence.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style27">In the first sentence, we do not know what color the fence 
  was prior to being painted, or even if it was a new fence that had never been 
  painted before. In the second sentence, not only do we know what color the fence 
  had been, but also that it was not previously unpainted, however, we do not 
  necessarily know what its new color is. This sort of iconicity is used to convey 
  a resultative state of affairs, i.e., by placing the adjective &#8216;white&#8217; 
  after the word &#8216;fence&#8217; (seemingly in violation of the usual adjective-before-noun 
  word order used in English), we describe a resulting state of affairs.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Yet another type of word-order iconicity is displayed in comparing 
  the following two sentences.</p>
<blockquote class="style27">
  <p align="justify">5) <em>Loretta gave Sue a wedding gift.</em><br />
    6) <em>Loretta gave a wedding gift to Sue.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Most grammar textbooks would state that these two sentences 
  are semantically equivalent, the first employing a &#8220;ditransitive&#8221; 
  pattern (i.e., juxtaposing an indirect object &#8216;Sue&#8217; with a direct 
  object &#8216;wedding gift&#8217;), while the second uses a &#8220;complement&#8221; 
  pattern in which the indirect object follows the direct object and is changed 
  to a prepositional phrase using &#8216;to.&#8217; However, there is a subtle 
  semantic distinction between the two sentences. The first strongly implies that 
  the wedding gift is for Sue, i.e., Sue is the bride and intended recipient. 
  The second sentence, however, invites the possibility that Sue is only a temporary 
  or circumstantial goal for the act of giving, but not the bride and intended 
  recipient. For example, if Sue is merely a guest at the wedding and Loretta 
  needed Sue&#8217;s help carrying an armload of wedding gifts, she might give 
  a wedding gift <em>to Sue</em>, but that does not mean she would <em>give Sue</em> a wedding gift. This type of iconicity distinguishing a recipient from a directional 
  goal is an example of what is termed &#8220;distance iconicity,&#8221; because 
  the two linked words are made more &#8220;distant&#8221; from each other in 
  the sentence as a reflection of their more circumstantial association.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Ithkuil does not display iconicity. While the order of words 
  in an Ithkuil phrase or sentence may coincidentally reflect a temporal or causative 
  sequence of events, this is not by syntactic design. Because of the myriad means 
  available in Ithkuil to morphologically distinguish sequence, cause-and-effect, 
  resulting states, and the distinction of recipients from directional goals, 
  no iconicity patterns are required.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">For example, we saw in sentences (1) and (2) above how English 
  &#8216;and&#8217; can be used to convey not just mere coordination, but also 
  a sequencing function. In <a href="07_suffixes.html#Sec7o4o3">Sections 
    7.4.3</a> and <a href="07_suffixes.html#Sec7o4o4">7.4.4</a>, we saw 
  that Ithkuil has no less than thirty-six suffixes (four suffix categories, each 
  with nine different degrees) which convey various coordinative and sequencing 
  patterns with great specificity. Thus, Ithkuil has no morpheme directly equivalent 
  to the ambiguous English word &#8216;and.&#8217; There is an affix corresponding 
  to &#8216;and&#8217; in its use as a mere additive listing device (e.g., &#8216;pears 
  and apples and bananas&#8217;), another corresponding to its use as an indicator 
  of simultaneity (e.g., <em>I clenched my fists and scowled</em>), another 
  corresponding to its use as an indicator of additional information (e.g., <em>The 
  clown likes children and loves to eat</em>), another to its use as an indicator 
  of parallel description or activity (e.g., <em>We went dancing and so did 
  they</em>), and yet another as a temporal sequencing indicator (e.g., <em>I 
went to the window and looked out</em>).</p>

</table>
<p align="justify" class="style27">It should be noted that when structuring an Ithkuil sentence, 
  particularly when translating from other languages such as English, care must 
  be given to avoid capturing irrelevant semantic information reflected by the 
  morphology of the source language and trying to find an equivalent or parallel 
  way to reflect those irrelevancies in the Ithkuil sentence. This can have a 
  profound effect on the morpho-syntactical structure of the resulting Ithkuil 
  sentence.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27">9.2.1 Arbitrary Delineations of Perspective or Point of View</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">One area where word-choice in English and other Western languages 
  arbitrarily affects sentence structure is in the unintentional schematicization 
  of a particular perspective or point of view. For example, consider the following 
  pair of sentences in English.</p>
<blockquote class="style27">
  <p align="justify">1) <em>The path climbs steeply out of the canyon.</em><br />
    2) <em>The path descends steeply into the canyon.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Both of these sentences are describing the same property of 
  the path &#8212; its steepness. The distinction in the sentences comes from 
  the point of view being reflected by the speaker. In sentence (1) the implied 
  point of view is from the bottom of the canyon upward, while in sentence (2) 
  the viewpoint is from the top of the canyon downward. What is important is that, 
  semantically, the point of view is of no relevance to the steepness of the path <em>per se</em>. So if the cognitive intent of the utterance is simply to describe 
  the vertical gradient of the path within the canyon, there would be only one 
  Ithkuil translation for both of these sentences, eschewing the point of view 
  entirely and restating the sentence to read: </p>
<blockquote class="style27">

<h3 align="justify" class="style27">9.2.2 Masking of Semantic or Participatory Roles</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Similarly, care must be made, when comparing Ithkuil sentence 
  structure with other languages, to note that Ithkuil grammar allows for a more 
  overt reflection of the underlying semantic roles inherent in a given sentence. 
  As a result, sentence structures in Western languages which &#8220;mask&#8221; 
  potentially anomalous semantic structures are avoided in Ithkuil. For example, 
  compare the following pairs of sentences.</p>
<div align="justify" class="style27">
  <table width="88%" border="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="4%">&nbsp;</td>
      <td width="50%">3a) <em>He supplied a report to the analyst.</em></td>
      <td width="46%">4a) <em>She applied a solvent to the stain.</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>3b) <em>He supplied the analyst a report.</em></td>
      <td>4b) <em>*She applied the stain a solvent.</em></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p align="justify" class="style27">The syntactical patterns of these two pairs of sentences are 
  identical, yet the word-order in sentence (4b) is ungrammatical (as indicated 
  by the asterisk), while the same word-order in sentence (3b) presents no problem. 
  The underlying reason for the difference is one of semantic role. While &#8216;analysts&#8217; 
  can function in the role of Recipients, &#8216;stains&#8217; cannot (they are 
  merely directional Goals, i.e., where the solvent gets applied). Cognitively, 
  stains cannot &#8220;possess&#8221; a solvent the way analysts can &#8220;possess&#8221; 
  a report. In Ithkuil, the semantic roles would be clearly defined by the case-markings 
  of the participants. Therefore, syntactically inconsistent pairs such as (3b) 
  and (4b) do not occur.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Sometimes, rather than semantic role, it is a participant&#8217;s 
  relationship to an underlying clause that presents the problem. For example, <em>He&#8217;s a tall president</em> means &#8216;He&#8217;s a president who 
  is tall.&#8217; So why doesn&#8217;t <em>He&#8217;s a likely president</em> mean &#8216;*He&#8217;s a president who is likely&#8217;? The reason is that, 
  while &#8216;tall&#8217; describes its adjacent referent &#8216;president,&#8217; 
  &#8216;likely&#8217; does not describe its adjacent referent. Rather, &#8216;likely&#8217; 
  describes an underlying process in which that referent is or will be engaged, 
  i.e., &#8216;running for president.&#8217; Therefore, while these two sentences 
  are morpho-syntactically identical in English, their Ithkuil translations are 
  quite different from one another morpho-syntactically: <br />

<h3 class="style27">9.2.3 Negation</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Negation is another morpho-semantic area where translation 
  from English or other Western languages can be tricky. Consider the English 
  sentence <em>Shelly doesn&#8217;t think they like her cooking</em>. Note this 
  sentence does not mean what a literal word-for-word analysis implies, i.e., 
  &#8216;That they like her cooking is not something that Shelly is thinking.&#8217; 
  Rather, the correct meaning is &#8216;Shelly thinks that they don&#8217;t like 
  her cooking.&#8217; Ithkuil is very precise in specifying exactly what components 
  of a sentence are to be negated. Use of the four affirmation/negation affixes 
  from <a href="07_suffixes.html#Sec7o4o9">Section 7.4.9</a>  in conjunction with a formative carries very specific information as to what 
  morphological components of a sentence are being affirmed or negated and to 
  what degree. Using these four affixes alone, Ithkuil can distinguish between 
  the following four sentences without any syntactic rearrangement of the words:</p>
<blockquote class="style27">
  <p align="justify"><em>I don&#8217;t want to begin singing.</em></p>
  <p align="justify"><em>I&#8217;m beginning to not want to sing.</em></p>
  <p align="justify"><em>I want to not begin singing.</em></p>
  <p align="justify"><em>I&#8217;m beginning to want to not sing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Thus when translating negative sentences into Ithkuil, care 
  must be taken to not syntactically &#8220;rearrange&#8221; a sentence as with <em>Shelly doesn&#8217;t think they like her cooking</em>. Additionally, Ithkuil 
  makes a morpho-semantic distinction not found in Western languages: the difference 
  between <strong>absolute negation</strong> and <strong>relative negation</strong>. 
  Absolute negation implies that the non-existence or non-occurrence of an entity, 
  state, or event is due to contextual inapplicability, while relative negation 
  indicates that the non-existence or non-occurrence is circumstantial. This distinction 
  is illustrated in the two sentences below:</p>
<blockquote class="style27">
  <p><br />
    <img src="/images/9-2-3a.jpg" width="129" height="43" /><br />
    <strong>Ilma&#355;&aacute;r<span class="style30"> &nbsp;</span>&ecirc;qeil.</strong><br />
    <span class="style30">DYN-&#8216;sing&#8217;-NRM/DEL/N/CSL/UNI-<span class="style49">NA1<sub>1</sub>/5</span>-</span><span class="style30">FML&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STA-&#8216;girl&#8217;-ACT-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL</span><br />
    <em>The woman doesn&#8217;t sing </em>[even though she can, i.e., she chooses 
    not to].</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><img src="/images/9-2-3b.jpg" width="129" height="42" /><br />
    Ilm&agrave;&#355;&icirc;r<span class="style30"> &nbsp;</span>&ecirc;qeil.</strong><br />
    <span class="style30">DYN-&#8216;sing&#8217;-NRM/DEL/N/CSL/UNI-<span class="style49">NA1<sub>1<sub><sub></sub></sub></sub>/4</span>-</span><span class="style30">FML&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STA-&#8216;girl&#8217;-ACT-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL</span><br />
    <em>The woman doesn&#8217;t sing</em> [because she can&#8217;t, i.e., she is 
    mute].</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0">

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC" class="style27"><div><strong>9.3 THE &#8220;CARRIER&#8221; 
    ROOT</strong></div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Since the Ithkuil declensional and conjugational system is 
  based on  multiple  patterns of vowel mutation, affixation, and shifts in tone and stress, proper 
  nouns such as personal and place names, as well as non-Ithkuil words from other 
  languages are by nature morpho-phonologically incompatible with such as system. 
  Nevertheless, such words can be declined or conjugated like any other Ithkuil 
  formative by means of the &#8220;carrier&#8221; root <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>-p-</strong></font>. 
  In addition to this use, the carrier root is employed in certain other contexts 
  as well, as described below.</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27"><br />
  9.3.1 Words that Cannot Take Affixes or Be Mutated</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">The three primary stems of the carrier root, <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(a)p-</strong></font><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, <strong>ep-</strong></font>, <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>up-</strong></font></strong>, are respectively associated with animate 
  beings (the two complementary derivatives <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>op-</strong></font> and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&acirc;p-</strong></font> being humans versus non-humans or 
  figuratively/metaphorically animate entities); inanimate entities (the two complementary 
  derivatives <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&ouml;p-</strong></font> and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&ecirc;p-</strong></font> being objectively concrete entities versus subjective entities such 
  as thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.); and finally intangible abstract referents 
  (the two complementary derivatives <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> &icirc;p-/<strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&ucirc;p-</strong></font></strong> </strong></font></strong>and <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&ocirc;p-</strong></font></strong></strong></font></strong> being place names and abstractions). The 
  carrier stem is placed immediately before the proper noun or foreign word or 
  phrase, then declined or conjugated normally for any desired morphological categories, 
  even verbal categories. The proper noun or foreign word or phrase itself is 
left unchanged. The non-Ithkuil word or phrase is pronounced with either high or rising tone on its last syllable, in order to clue the listener that the following syllable/word returns to being Ithkuil. For those rare instances where the non-Ithkuil word or phrase natively carries grammatical tone (e.g., properly pronounced Cantonese), the end of the phrase can be indicated by either a pause in speech or repetition of the carrier-stem following the phrase. (Note: this repeated carrier-stem would not be indicated in writing - see <a href="11_script.htm#Sec11o4">Sec. 11.4</a>.)</p>
<p align="justify" class="style27"><br />
</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27"><br />
9.3.2 Emphasizing or Highlighting a Particular Category</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">Another use of the carrier root is to emphasize or topicalize 
  a particular affix or grammatical element associated with a word. For example, 
  in English we can say &#8216;a <em>big</em> house&#8217; with extra intonation 
  on the word &#8216;big&#8217; to emphasize that word. To accomplish such emphasis 
  in Ithkuil, the carrier root is used with the augmentative suffix in conjunction 
  with the noun &#8216;house&#8217; as opposed to simply using the augmentative 
  suffix on the stem for &#8216;house.&#8217; No change in vocal pitch or intonation 
  is required, as the grammatically unnecessary use of the carrier root serves 
  to accomplish the required emphasis. Any morphological category manifested by 
  a carrier root rather than an adjunct or mutation serves to emphasize that category. 
  (It should be noted that the use of optional combination and euphonic adjuncts 
  do not accomplish such emphasis. Their use versus non-use imparts no difference 
  in emphasis for the particular morphological categories contained in the adjunct.) <br />
</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style27"><br />
9.3.3 Titles of Address</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style27">It should be noted that the use of the carrier root in front 
  of the names of persons serves to function as a title of address corresponding 
  to English <em>Mister</em>, Ms. or <em>Miss</em>. There is no distinction of 
  gender or marital status conveyed by the term. </p>
