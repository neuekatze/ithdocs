For those readers already familiar with my constructed language Ithkuil v1, this new language, Ilaksh, represents a revision of the Ithkuil language to allow easier pronunciation for those persons who have an interest in trying to speak Ithkuil but are daunted by the complex phonology (sound system).  The revision consists mostly of a simplification of the phonology of the language and a complete restructuring of the morpho-phonology.  While most of the morphology of the original Ithkuil remains intact, I have taken the opportunity to revise several morphological elements with which I\u2019ve been less than satisfied.</p> <p>Like Ithkuil, the purpose of Ilaksh is to present a philosophical design for a hypothetical language featuring extreme morpho-phonological conciseness while overtly presenting a much deeper level of human cognition than is found in natural human languages, i.e., maximal communication of underlying cognitive intent coupled with maximal morpho-phonological efficiency.</p> <p>The specific differences found in Ilaksh compared to Ithkuil are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The number of phonemes (i.e., relevant speech sounds) has been reduced from 82 to 40.  I have eliminated what many readers would consider the most difficult-to-pronounce phonemes.  Specifically, the number of consonants has been reduced from 65 to 30 and the number of vowels from 17 to ten.  In partial compensation of this reduction, however, Ithkuil\u2019s five tones have been increased to seven in Ilaksh.  Tone also plays a more pervasive role in Ilaksh than in Ithkuil.</p> </li> <li> <p>The reduction in total phonemes has required a drastic restructuring of Ithkuil\u2019s morpho-phonology, i.e., the patterns in which phonemes (speech sounds) are mapped to morphemes (meaningful word-components).  All in all, Ilaksh is more agglutinative and less synthetic in its grammar than Ithkuil.  As a result, Ilaksh looks and sounds rather differently than Ithkuil, and the structure of the words is different as well.  Therefore, to all surface appearances, both visual and aural, Ilaksh is a different language than Ithkuil.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ithkuil\u2019s four Levels have been expanded to 18 in Ilaksh.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ithkuil\u2019s 81 noun cases have been consolidated to 72 in Ilaksh. However, a system of 24 new specialized noun cases have been added which operate in conjunction with the expansion of the Level categories, resulting in a total of 96 noun cases in Ilaksh.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ithkuil\u2019s nine Validations (evidential categories) have been expanded to 14 in Ilaksh.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Ithkuil category of Focus has been eliminated as a morphological category in Ilaksh.  Topic and Focus are primarily handled at the syntactic level in Ilaksh rather than at the morphological level.  As a result, word-order is more important in Ilaksh than in Ithkuil.</p> </li> <li> <p>The 259 Derivations of Ithkuil verbs, used to expand upon the seven basic verb Conflations, have been eliminated.  Instead, Ilaksh now allows the option to incorporate any formative stem into a verbal stem, i.e., Ilaksh verbs are optionally incorporative. The category of Conflation has been renamed Function and an additional Function has been added bring the number to eight, compared to Ithkuil's seven. </p> </li> <li> <p>The HORTATIVE has been moved from a Validation category to an Illocution category.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The number of morpho-semantic classes of formative stems has been reduced from 17 in Ithkuil to ten in Ilaksh.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Ilaksh uses a completely different writing system than Ithkuil.  The new system is non-linear and two-dimensional, and almost entirely morphemic in nature, as opposed to the morpho-phonemic script used for Ithkuil (a sample of Ilaksh writing is visible above in the header/title area of this page). </p> </li> </ul> <p>I wish to thank all of those who have taken an interest in Ithkuil and who have patiently looked forward to Ilaksh. I hope you find the new site interesting. And I especially wish to thank Stanislav Kozlovskiy, whose 2004 article \u201cThe Speed of Thought\u201d brought Ithkuil to the attention of so many people. \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e, \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0441!

The voiceless dorso-uvular unaspirated plosive found in Arabic, Inuit and many American Indian and Caucasian languages. Similar to an unaspirated k-sound but made by pressing the tongue against the uvula (the little \u201cpunching bag\u201d hanging at the back of the palate) as opposed to the soft palate. IPA [q].</li> <li>r: This sound is a single flap of the tongue tip as in Spanish caro or pero. When geminated (doubled) it becomes a trill as in Spanish carro or perro. A voiced apico-alveolar retroflex flap/trill; IPA [\u027e], [r].</li> <li>\u0159: No English equivalent. Like the throaty or \u201cgargled\u201d r-sound found in colloquial French and German.

The smooth voiceless dorso-velar fricative found in Russian (spelled x in Cyrillic) and in Latin American (but not Castilian) Spanish j. Can be approximated by putting one's tongue in position as if to pronounce a k-sound, and while holding the tongue in this position, breathing an h-sound instead. IPA [x].</li> <li>xh: No English equivalent. The rough voiceless dorso-uvular fricative (or trill) found in German ach. Can be approximated by means of a dry gargle without vocal chord vibration. IPA [\u03c7].</li> <li>y: As in English yet, yam. A voiced dorso-palatal glide (or approximant); IPA [j]. </li> <li>z: As in English zoo, wizard.

A voiced lamino-alveolar dorso-palatal grooved sibilant fricative; IPA [\u0292].</li> <li>\u2019: This sound is the glottal stop heard between the two vowels in English oh-oh or as the sound heard in the word fattening as pronounced by most American English speakers. This sound is very common in other languages such as Hawaiian, Arabic, Hebrew, etc. A voiceless bi-glottal stop; IPA [\u0294].</li> </ul> <p>1.2.1.1 Aspirated Consonants: The consonants p, t, k, q, c and \u010d are all unaspirated, i.e., without the accompanying puff of air characteristic of English voiceless stops and affricates. In Ithkuil each of these has an aspirated counterpart, pronounced like the unaspirated version but with a distinct expulsion of air, more so than in English. These aspirated counterparts are written with a following superscript h; thus: p\u02b0, t\u02b0, k\u02b0, q\u02b0, c\u02b0 and \u010d\u02b0.</p> <p>1.2.1.2 Ejective Consonants: The same six consonants immediately above also have ejective counterparts, which do not exist in any major Western language, but are found in languages such as Amharic, Georgian, most of the Caucasian languages, and many American Indian languages. Ejectives (also called glottalized consonants) are consonants accompanied by simultaneous closure and sudden release of the glottis (vocal chords), which gives the sound a distinct \u201cpopped\u201d or explosive quality. Ejectives are indicated by an apostrophe following the consonant, thus: p\u2019, t\u2019, k\u2019, q\u2019, c\u2019 and \u010d\u2019.</p> <p>1.2.1.3 Syllabic consonants: The consonants, l, m, n, \u0148, and r can be pronounced as full syllables in absence of a vowel. The phenomenon of syllabic consonants is fairly common and occurs in colloquial English expressions such as \u2018hmm\u2019 (as when pondering a thought), \u2018mm-hmm\u2019 (an expression of approval or agreement), as well as with the consonants n and l as in the second syllable of words like button and little. In Ithkuil, these five syllabic consonants can appear as word-initial syllables preceding a consonant as in ntal. However, they also occur in special geminate (i.e., doubled) clusters where the second \u201chalf\u201d of the geminated cluster is pronounced as a separate syllable. These special dyssyllabic geminates are indicated by writing a hyphen between the two syllabic \u201chalves,\u201d e.g., hom-m, il-lui, ti\u0148-\u0148ax. Syllabic consonants count as full syllables for purposes of stress rules (see Sec. 1.3.3).</p>"},{"location":"1/#122-pronunciation-of-vowels","title":"1.2.2 Pronunciation of Vowels","text":"<p>There are thirteen vowel phonemes, all of which are pure sounds, not glided into diphthongs as in English.</p> <ul> <li>a: A low unrounded central vowel as in Spanish or Italian.

This vowel may be pronounced in either of two ways, whichever is easier for the speaker. The first is as the high central unrounded vowel of Russian \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c, IPA [] or X-SAMPA [1]. The second way is to pronounce it as the high back unrounded vowel found in Turkish (spelled with an undotted i), IPA [] or X-SAMPA [M].

All Ithkuil diphthongs are \u201cfalling\u201d diphthongs, i.e., the first vowel of the diphthong receives the primary articulation while the second becomes semi-vocalic (sometimes referred to as semi-consonantal or an \u201coff-glide\u201d). There are 12 diphthongs in Ithkuil, described as follows:</p> <ul> <li>ai: Pronounced as in Spanish or Italian; like English i in white or ice.</li> <li>ei: As in Spanish or Italian; like English ai in rain or ei in rein.</li> <li>\u00ebi: No standard English equivalent; a combination of the vowel sound in American English rut + an English y-sound.

When diphthongs are broken up into separate syllables for this purpose, the second character of the diphthong (i.e., either -i or -u) carries a circumflex accent above it to show the syllabification. In such instances, this circumflex does not indicate a long vowel, but merely the separation of the syllables.</p>"},{"location":"1/#124-orthographic-representation-of-dissyllabic-vowel-conjuncts","title":"1.2.4 Orthographic Representation of Dissyllabic Vowel Conjuncts","text":"<p>Dissyllabic vowel conjuncts, wherever they might be confused with a diphthong, are written with a grave accent ( ` ) over the second vowel to indicate it is a separate syllable (unless this second vowel is, in fact, the stressed syllable \u2013 see Section 1.3.3 below for rules on indicating stress).

These variances, known as allophones, while audible to a trained linguist, are often indistinguishable to lay native speakers of a given language, in that these allophonic variances do not change the meaning of a word and thus play no functional role in the language. As an example, compare the two t-sounds in the English words top and stop. The former is aspirated (i.e., accompanied by a distinct puff of air), while the latter is unaspirated, giving the two sounds a different phonetic quality. However, because consonant aspiration does not function phonemically in English, the difference in the two t-sounds is unnoticeable to most native speakers of English, even though it would be highly noticeable to speakers of languages where consonant aspiration is phonemically relevant (e.g., Hindi and many other Indic languages).</p> <p>Although such allophonic distinctions are arbitrary within a given language, they are not random; rather, their patterns are completely regular and predictable for any given language (as is true for consonant aspiration in English). Failure to follow the rules for allophonic distinctions when learning a foreign language will result in the speaker having a noticeable \u201cforeign accent\u201d to native speakers of the language (as do most French, Italians, and Spanish-speakers when trying to pronounce English \u201ctop\u201d without aspirating the initial t-sound, due to the lack of consonant aspiration in Romance languages.)</p> <p> 1.2.5.1 Consonantal Allophones. The significant allophonic distinctions for Ithkuil consonants are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dy: This consonant cluster may be pronounced either as it is spelled, or as the voiced dorso-palatal unaspirated plosive found in Hungarian and Czech where it is spelled gy and d\u00b4 respectively. Sort of like a g+y sound as in English big year pronounced rapidly, with the g-sound pronounced with the tongue against the hard palate as opposed to the soft palate. IPA [\u0272].  </p> </li> <li> <p>hh: The geminated version of Ithkuil h is pronounced in either of two ways: (1) as a \u201cbi-dental\u201d fricative, in that the jaw is completely closed and the upper and lower teeth are in near-contact along their entire length; the resulting sound is somewhat similar in timbre to both a voiceless interdental fricative (as in English thin) as well as the English f-sound, however there is absolutely no contact by the tongue with the teeth or gums when pronouncing this sound; no IPA equivalent; or (2) as the voiceless pharyngeal fricative found in Arabic (spelled \u062d) and in various Northwest and Northeast Caucasian languages. This second allophone should not be employed if the resulting pharyngealization distorts the timbre of the adjacent vowels to the extent that their place of articulation changes (e.g., the vowel \u00fb being made to sound like \u00f4).  </p> </li> <li> <p>ly: This consonant cluster may be pronounced either as it is spelled, or as the voiced palatal lateral liquid continuant found in Castillian Spanish calle, Portuguese olhar, or Italian egli. For English speakers, this can best be approximated by placing the tongue in the position to say the y in yes, and while keeping the tongue in that position flat against the hard palate, pronouncing an l-sound instead without touching the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge behind the front teeth. IPA [\u028e].</p> </li> <li> <p>ny: This consonant cluster may be pronounced either as it is spelled, or as the voiced palatal nasal found in Spanish a\u00f1o, Italian agnello, Portuguese caminho, or French champagne. For English speakers, this can best be approximated by placing the tongue in the position to say the y in yes, and while keeping the tongue in that position flat against the hard palate, pronouncing an n-sound instead without touching the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge behind the front teeth. IPA [\u0272].</p> </li> <li> <p>\u0159: In normal speech, this phoneme is pronounced as a voiced dorso-uvular approximant (non-trilled) continuant, similar to the throaty r-sound found in colloquial French and German, IPA [\u0281]. However, in emphatic articulation or hyper-enunciated speech, this sound becomes a voiced dorso-uvular trill, IPA [R].  </p> </li> <li> <p>\u0159x: The combination of \u0159 before x causes the x to be pronounced as a voicelss uvular fricative, as in German Bach or the Castilian pronunciation of Spanish j.</p> </li> <li> <p>ty: This consonant cluster may be pronounced either as it is spelled, or as a voiceless unaspirated dorso-palatal plosive, the unvoiced counterpart to dy above. Like a k-sound but unaspirated (i.e., without any accompanying puff of air) and produced farther forward in the mouth by pressing the tongue to the hard palate, not the soft palate as with English k. The result should sound somewhat like a k+y as in backyard when spoken rapidly. IPA [c].</p> </li> <li> <p>bm, dn, km, kn, pm, tn: When in word-initial position, the first consonant of these conjuncts is pronounced with nasal rather than oral release. To achieve this, place the tongue and/or lips in position to pronounce the first consonant, initiate the airstream from the lungs to pronounce it, but instead of releasing the sound, and without moving the tongue or lips, pronounce the second nasal consonant instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>hl, hm, hn, h\u0148, hr, hw: Each of these consonant conjuncts, when word-initial, or syllable-initial following another consonant, are not pronounced as separate consonants, but rather as unvoiced counterparts to the liquid or nasal consonant that forms the second member of the conjunct. To approximate these sounds, place the mouth in the position to pronounce an Ithkuil l, m, n, \u0148, r, or w, and without moving the tongue or lips, breath a clear h-sound instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u2019: As previously described in Sec. 1.2.2.1, in Ithkuil words where a glottal stop is followed by a consonant (e.g., ka\u2019tal or morui\u2019ss), the glottal stop is usually followed by a very briefly pronounced epenthetic vowel sound before the following consonant is pronounced. This vowel may be pronounced in either of two ways, whichever is easier for the speaker. The first is as the high central unrounded vowel of Russian \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c, IPA [\u0268]. The second way is to pronounce it as the high back unrounded vowel found in Turkish (spelled with an undotted i), IPA [\u0268]. Both of these vowels are extremely short in duration and may even be de-voiced if the following consonant is voiceless.</p> </li> </ul> <p>1.2.5.2 Vocalic Allophones. As previously stated in Section 1.2.2, the Ithkuil vowels i and u have two different pronunciations. Specifically, they are pronounced as the vowels in American English sit and put respectively if they appear by themselves, not adjacent to another vowel or not as part of a diphthong. However, when part of a dissyllabic vowel conjunct, their pronunciation is as follows:</p> <p>For disyllabic vowel conjuncts beginning with the vowel i- (e.g., ia, ie, io, i\u00f9, etc.), the initial i- is pronounced as the high unrounded front vowel in Spanish or Italian libro, or German siegen. IPA [i].  For disyllabic vowel conjuncts where the second member is i, (e.g., a\u00ec, u\u00ec, \u00f6\u00ec, etc.), the i may be pronounced either as the lax vowel in English sit and German sitzen (IPA [I], or as the high unrounded front vowel in Spanish or Italian libro, or German siegen. IPA [i]. For disyllabic vowel conjuncts beginning with the vowel u- (e.g., ua, ue, uo, u\u00ec, etc.), the initial u- is pronounced as the high rounded back vowel in Spanish or Italian puta or crudo. IPA [u]. For disyllabic vowel conjuncts where the second member is u, (e.g., a\u00f9, i\u00f9, \u00f6\u00f9, etc.), the u may be pronounced either as the lax vowel in English put and German putsch (IPA [\u028a], or as the high rounded back vowel in Spanish or Italian puta or crudo. IPA or X-SAMPA [u]. In word-final position the vowel i, when not part of a diphthong, is pronounced as the high unrounded front vowel in Spanish or Italian libro, or German siegen. IPA or X-SAMPA [i]. Similarly, the vowel u in word-final position and not part of a diphthong, is pronounced as the high rounded back vowel in Spanish or Italian puta or crudo. IPA [u].</p> <p>Additional vocalic allophones:</p> <p>For disyllabic vowel conjuncts beginning with the vowel e- and the second vowel is other than \u00ec or \u00f9 (i.e., ea, eo, e\u00f6), the initial e- is pronounced as the mid unrounded front vowel of Spanish este or Italian cadere or French d\u00e9j\u00e0; IPA [e]. For disyllabic vowel conjuncts beginning with the vowel o- and the second vowel is other than \u00ec or \u00f9 (i.e., oa, oe), the initial o- is pronounced as the mid-low rounded back vowel in Spanish or Italian cosa; IPA  [o].</p>"},{"location":"1/#13-phonological-processes-and-rules","title":"1.3 PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND RULES","text":"<p>Besides the actual inventory of consonant and vowels, all languages have phonological processes which affect how those consonants or vowels are combined and phonetically articulated.

While gemination does not occur in English on true phonological grounds, it does occur on morpho-phonological grounds, as seen in the difference in pronunciation of the phrase \u2018a natural\u2019 versus \u2018unnatural.\u2019 There are many languages, however, where phonologically-based gemination is an intrinsic component of the phonology (e.g., Italian, Japanese, Finnish).</p> <p>In Ithkuil, most consonants can be geminated. Also noteworthy is that gemination of certain consonants is allowed in both word-initial and word-final position. The following are the specific rules for consonant gemination:</p> <p>1.3.1.1 Intervocalic Gemination: All consonants are capable of intervocalic gemination (i.e., when between two vowels) except for y, w and the glottal stop \u2019.</p> <p>1.3.1.2 Word-Initial and Word-Final Gemination: The following consonants, in addition to being capable of intervocalic gemination, are also capable of being geminated in both word-initial and word-final position: c, \u00e7, \u010d, j, l, m, n, \u0148, r, \u0159, s, \u0161, z, \u017c and \u017e.</p> <p>1.3.1.3 Pronunciation of Geminated Consonants: Consonants which are continuants (i.e., able to be sounded for an indefinite duration), specifically \u00e7, dh, f, l, m, n, r, \u0159, s, \u0161, \u0163, v, x, z, and \u017e, are simply pronounced for twice as long in duration when geminated. Geminated r is pronounced as a rapid apico-alveolar trill like rr in Spanish or Italian.</p> <p>The non-aspirated plosive consonants b, d, g, k, p, q and t, when geminated, are momentarily held, then released, much like the two d-sounds in the English phrase bad dog when spoken rapidly. For their aspirated or ejective counterparts, the aspiration or ejectivization occurs upon release.</p> <p>The pronunciation of affricates (c, \u010d, j, and \u017c) when geminated depends on whether or not they are intervocalic (between two vowels) versus word-initial or word-final position. If intervocalic, they are pronounced by momentarily holding the initial stop (plosive) component of the affricate before releasing it into the fricative or sibilant portion, e.g., \u010d\u010d is pronounced as [tt\u0161]. For their aspirated or ejective counterparts, the aspiration or ejectivization occurs upon release into the fricative portion of the affricate. When in word-initial or word-final position, geminated pronunciation is achieved by simply lengthening the sibilant continuant portion of the affricate (i.e., the second sound of each affricate). Thus, \u010d\u010d in word-initial or word-final position is pronounced as [t\u0161\u0161].</p> <p>1.3.1.4 Romanized Orthography of Geminates. Consonants written as single characters are simply written double when geminated, e.g., bb, *\u010d\u010d, *dd, nn, \u0161\u0161. Aspirates and ejectives indicate the following superscript-h or apostrophe diacritics only after the second character, e.g., \u010d\u010d\u2019, tt\u02b0.

This means that tone of voice is used to convey grammatical information, unlike Western languages which use tone and pitch changes \u201csupra-segmentally\u201d to mark various morpho-semantic features. For example, in English rising intonation of the voice signals a question, while other specific pitch contours signify emphasis, disgust, irony, and other attitudes. Ithkuil marks such features morphologically, i.e., within the words themselves (such as with affixes or variances in mood categories).</p> <p>There are seven tones used in Ithkuil, one of which, mid tone, is considered to be morpho-phonologically neutral. The other six tones are low, high, falling, rising, rising-falling and falling-rising, and are considered functionally significant. Each word carries one functionally significant tone, pronounced beginning with the stressed syllable and continuously carried through any following syllables until the end of the word. Unstressed syllables prior to the stressed syllable have neutral mid tone. Therefore, the function of mid tone is solely to indicate the start of a new word since any preceding word must end in a tone other than mid. Like natural tone languages, the tones do not correspond to any exact pitch, but are relative for each individual speaker and utterance. The relative pitch of the tones is illustrated below:</p> <p></p> <p>1.3.2.1 Indicating Tone in the Romanized Transliteration.

Every language    (and particularly every language family) divides the world up differently in    terms of what sorts of concepts are made into words and how the meanings of    those words reflect the reality around us. In other words, the lexico-semantics    of a language answers the questions what semantic concepts does this language      psycho-linguistically categorize into autonomous words and how are each of these  categories internally organized?</p> <p>Lexico-semantics is extremely important in Ithkuil for two    related reasons:</p> <p>1) Ithkuil morpho-phonology only allows for 3600 possible root    words, as explained in Chapter 2. This means that the concepts chosen to be    conveyed by these roots must be carefully selected to insure the widest range    of conceptualization possible within such a limited framework.</p> <p>2) We have seen throughout this work how Ithkuil\u2019s matrix-like    grammatical structure allows for an incredible amount of synergy in terms of    morphological word-derivation, generating wholly new, emergent concepts from    word-roots, not simply mere conjugations, declensions, and transparent derivations.    In order to ensure the maximum amount of dynamism in deriving new concepts morphologically    from existing word-roots, it is important that those initial roots be carefully    selected in terms of meaning.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will examine the many considerations that    go in to the assigning of concepts to those 3600 roots, in order to optimally    accomplish what has been demonstrated throughout this work: using the dynamics    of Ithkuil morphology to eliminate the need for the hundred thousand or more    autonomous word roots of natural languages, or to put it colloquially, \u201cgetting    the most lexico-semantic bang for the morpho-phonological buck.\u201d </p> <p>We will start first with a review of key components in the    systemic design of Ithkuil morphology. This will be followed by sections on    those areas of Ithkuil lexico-semantics which are most profoundly distinct from    Western languages. </p> <p>The last section deals with comparison to Western categorizations,    examining how Ithkuil lexico-semantics reinterprets certain concepts considered    \u201cfundamental\u201d in English and other Western languages.</p> <p> </p> Note on Ithkuil's Implicit \u201cTheory of Meaning\u201d <p>For those readers who may be trained in linguistics, particulary cognitive linguistics, it should be noted that at this point in the author\u2019s development of the language, a traditional Enlightenment-based theory of meaning, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between a lexeme and its external \u201cin-the-world\u201d referent, has been implicitly assumed for convenience and/or expediency\u2019s sake. A more careful and rigourous construction for Ithkuil\u2019s lexico-semantics, given the author\u2019s stated design goals (as described in the Introduction section), would not assume such a theory of meaning, but would rather incorporate more recent findings of cognitive science and cognitive linguistics to reflect embodied meaning and metaphor-based conceptualization. However, pursuing such a foundation for the lexico-semantics of the language would, in the author\u2019s opinion, be extremely time-consuming (on the order of many additional years, perhaps decades, to construct). Rather than withdraw the language from public availability for such reasons, the author has chosen instead to adopt a traditional/formalist foundation for its lexico-semantics essentially out of convenience, in order to be able to showcase the language's morphology. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 10.1 SYSTEMATIC MORPHOLOGICAL DERIVATION <p>Ithkuil systematically uses its myriad of morphological categories    to derive secondary concepts from more basic concepts, often eliminating the    need for separate lexicalization, i.e., eliminating the need to create separate    word-roots for new but related concepts as is so often the case in Western languages.    We will explore this system of morphological derivation more closely, particularly    in regard to its universality across the spectrum of Ithkuil word-roots.</p>    10.1.1 Stem Derivation from Roots <p>We have already seen many applied examples of the above-described    concepts, particularly in Section      2.3 et seq. regarding the use of the three different Vr vowel patterns to derive a trinary array of interrelated stems from a root, as well as shifting the Vr vowel  of those trinary stems to in turn derive two separate arrays    of complementary stems from the initial holistic array of stems. Through this    system of vowel shifts, we saw how a single root generates no    less than eighteen formative stems, each functioning as a noun or verb. This    is illustrated below using the example root -k-\u2018TRANSLATIVE MOTION\u2019. </p> <p>-K- \u2018TRANSLATIVE MOTION\u2019</p> INFORMAL Designation FORMAL Designation 1. ak- move/motion    from one place to another 1. ak\u00e1- travel/traverse;    journey 2. ek- set in motion/self-directed    movement from one place to another 2. ek\u00e1- set    off for/journey to/directed travel toward 3. uk- move/movement between one    place and another (i.e., along line between two points) 3. uk\u00e1- travel/journey along way    between two places COMPLEMENTARY STEMS COMPLEMENTARY STEMS 1. ok- go    = movement outward/away 1. \u00e2k- come    = movement inward/toward 1. ok\u00e1- go traveling,    be off 1. \u00e2k\u00e1- journey    to(ward) 2. \u00f6k- go    away/move away = increase distance from a starting point 2. \u00eak- come    toward/to close the distance = decrease distance toward endpoint 2. \u00f6k\u00e1- travel/journey    further away from starting point 2. \u00eak\u00e1- reach    vicinity of, close in on destination 3. \u00eek/\u00fbk- leave/depart = move away from    one point towards another 3. \u00f4k- approach = approach one point    from direction of another 3. \u00eek\u00e1/\u00fbk\u00e1- depart/departure    from starting point on journey toward elsewhere 3. \u00f4k\u00e1- arrive/arrival,    reach destination  <p> As described in Chapter 2, this hierarchical pattern of stem    derivation and division into complementary stems from a more basic or underlying    \u201cholistic\u201d stem allows for significant collapsing in the number    of word-roots necessary compared to Western languages, as words that are semantically    interrelated in a hierarchical or complementary fashion can be derived morphologically    from a basic root, as opposed to being assigned separate word-roots as in other    languages. The above root -k- demonstrates how concepts such come versus go are expressed as complementary derivations of a single underlying concept TRANSLATIVE      MOTION. All such complementary stems based on participant perspective  are similarly patterned, e.g., lead/follow, buy/sell, give/take, etc.</p> <p>Additionally, this hierarchical structure of stem derivation    from a single root using vocalic infixes allows for the creation of \u201cbuilt-in\u201d    classification schemes and taxonomies for concepts which require them. Biological    taxonomies, for example, can be easily accommodated under this scheme, first    dividing the two Forms (Designations) of the root into the animal itself versus    the animal as a resource, the holistic stems indicating first the generic species    then male versus female. The complementary stems then make the further distinction    between wild versus domesticated for the informal stem and between food/prey    and derived or processed products for the formal stem. </p> <p>Using the nine degrees of the Stem    Specific Derivative SSD suffix -k from Section 7.4.13 on such a root, we can extend this scheme to denote specific    parts, products or derived resources such as the milk, oil, meat, skin or    hide, tail, tusk or horn, hair or fur (e.g., wool), etc. The Degree      of Maturity MAT suffix -p<sup>h</sup> from Section 7.4.10 is also applied to indicate the developmental stage of the  animal, providing derived equivalents    to words such as foal, fawn, lamb or cub, from horse,  deer, goat, or lion.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 10.1.2 The Use of Derivational Suffixes <p>In Chapter 7, we saw how many of the approximately 200 suffix categories    can be used to generate both derivative concepts  as    well as amalgamated gestalts carrying a new holistic meaning. As an example,    here are only ten of the various new concepts which can be derived through affixes    from the stem el- \u2018say something [i.e.,    communicate a verbal message]\u2019:</p>      elalaiq\u2019 \u2018share a secret\u2019 suffix = DSR2/8        elal\u00eap\u0163 \u2018news\u2019 suffix = ATC2/3      elal\u00e2xh \u2018quip\u2019 suffix = SCO2/5        elaluiq \u2018praise, adulation\u2019 suffix = NTR2/9      elal\u00f4pt \u2018lie\u2019 [= tell a lie] suffix = REA2/7      elalain\u0163 \u2018shout out a message\u2019 suffix = STR2/8        elal\u00ean \u2018persuasive person, a persuader\u2019 suffix = AGC2/3        elal\u00f4n \u2018liaison, a go-between\u2019 suffix = AGC2/7  elaliu\u00e7auk\u00e7 \u2018whisper sweet nothings\u2019 suffixes = AFT2/1 + FRC2/2 elaliuc\u00eaps \u2018cuss, curse\u2019 suffixes = UNQ 2/1 + MTA 2/3 <p> Similarly the use of the Consent CNS suffix, the Reason RSN suffix, the Expectation XPT suffix, the Deliberateness DLB suffix, the Enablement ENB suffix, the Agency/Intent AGN suffix, and the Impact IMP suffix from Section      7.4.12 in conjunction w/ Transrelative cases (Sec.      4.3), provides a means for describing extremely subtle scenarios of causation,    willingness, enablement, hindrance, etc. which other languages can only capture    via long-winded paraphrase. Employing this array of affixes and cases, a sentence    such as The singer stopped the boys from playing around can be translated    into Ithkuil in many syntactically equivalent (but morphologically distinct)    ways to indicate whether the singer used physical force or persuasion to stop    the boys, whether she stopped them via an indirect enabling means (such as turning    out the lights), or whether it was the boys themselves who stopped upon hearing    her voice or seeing her beauty, or even by her mere presence interrupting them    (such as walking in on them inadvertently), as well as the degree of willingness    or consent with which they stopped. The following example sentence further illustrates  the complex detail which these suffixes make possible:</p> <p>     \u00d4q\u00f6l\u00f6\u0148tausp\u00fbls \u00a0\u00ea\u013cnel\u00f4zra \u00a0ia\u00e7taxhtiams\u00ed\u0163. STA-\u2018man\u2019-EFF-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-XPT1/2-DLB2/2-ENB1/6-IFL\u00a0\u00a0 STA-\u2018bird\u2019-ABS-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IMP2/7-IFL  \u00a0\u00a0     DYN-\u2018room\u2019-NRM/DEL/U/COA/CST-AGN2/9-DEV1/1-FML  Aided by the bird\u2019s own stupidity, the man unexpectedly and accidentally          killed it without even realizing he\u2019d done so, by inadvertently letting    it out of the house.__________ </p> <p> The  DEV suffix from Sec. 7.4.9,    in first degree, roughly corresponds to the reversive prefixes of English such    as \u2018un-,\u2019 \u2018de-,\u2019 and \u2018dis-\u2019 to indicate    the undoing or opposite of a word. However, in Ithkuil this suffix is productive    for all semantically applicable stems and operates in conjunction with Modality     (Section 6.1)    and the Modality suffixes from Section 7.4.11 to extend the system of modalities, as illustrated by the following:</p> <p>promise to + DEV/1 =      foreswear, vow never to     can (know how to) +  DEV/1  = be ignorant of     decide to +  DEV/1  = avoid     offer to +  DEV/1  = refuse to     agree upon/to +  DEV/1  = decline to/abstain from     like to +  DEV/1  = loathe     fear to +  DEV/1  = love to     need to +  DEV/1  = dispensable, unnecessary to, can dispense with</p> 10.1.3 The Use of Configuration, Affiliation, and Context  <p>Each of these categories has means to generate amalgamate,    holistic, or emergent concepts from a more basic underlying stem.</p> <p>10.1.3.1 Configuration: In Sec.    3.1 we saw how applying each of the nine Configuration categories to a stem    often generates forms based on amalgamation of sets which require complete relexification    when translated into English. Examples are:</p> <p>bone \u2192 skeleton    strut/girder \u2192 frame \u2192 framework      component \u2192 structure \u2192 system      ingredient \u2192 compound      food \u2192 dish \u2192 meal      tool \u2192 toolset      do/perform \u2192 coordinate      vehicle \u2192 convoy      person \u2192 group \u2192 crowd \u2192 masses      activity \u2192 process.</p> <p>10.1.3.2 Affiliation: In Sec.    3.2 we saw how the four Affiliations can generate new concepts based on    delineations of purpose, benefit, or function. Examples include: </p> <p>group \u2192 team,    grove \u2192 orchard     assortment \u2192 collection \u2192 junk     process \u2192 plan</p> <p>10.1.3.3 Context: In Sec.    3.6.4 we encountered the AMALGAMATE context, which    serves to identify a stem specifically as a gestalt entity, composed of objective    and subjective/social elements or components which contribute to the overall    nature of the stem. Depending on the stem to which it is applied, the use of    the amalgamate can cause relexification in translating to English. Examples: </p> <p>demeanor \u2192 personality   craftsmanship \u2192 artistry     career \u2192 livelihood     (one\u2019s) past \u2192 (one\u2019s)      life     to look after/tend \u2192 nurture</p> 10.1.4 The Use of Designation and Version <p>In Section    3.7 on Designation as well as Section      5.8 on Version, we saw how both of these morphological categories create    distinctions in word-stems which usually require relexification in translation.    The following word pairs illustrate such relexification:</p> (the) past \u2192 history see \u2192 observe writings \u2192 literature one \u2192 single/singular wordplay \u2192 rhetoric hear \u2192 listen behavior \u2192 demeanor desire \u2192 request wander \u2192 travel query \u2192 research eat \u2192 dine ponder \u2192 analyze containment \u2192 storage path \u2192 route <p>   Again we see that application of morphological categories    to word-stems serves to generate forms which substitute for lexical distinctions  in other languages, thus helping to reduce the size of the Ithkuil lexicon.</p> <p> </p> 10.1.5 The Use of Phase and Extension <p>The use of the nine Phases, as explained in Sec.    5.5, used in conjunction with the category of Extension (Sec.      3.4) gives rise to an elaborate means by which to describe phenomena in    terms of duration, periodicity, repetition, iterativity, and cyclic phenomena.    When used in conjunction with the twelve Modulative suffixes from Sec.      7.4.7, the Iteration ITN and Repetition RPN suffixes from Sec. 7.4.5 and the Intensity ITY suffix from Sec. 7.4.10,    Phase becomes an extremely powerful means to describe with great subtlety all    phenomena which display vibratory, oscillative, wavering, on-off, or variative    movement, motion, or intensity. As an example, specific application of the various    phases combined with the aforementioned suffixes and other suffix categories to    a single stem  -nt- \u2018[make] sound\u2019 can give rise to translations for all of the following    English words:</p> acoustic         audible         auditory         bang         blast         boom         buzz         cacophony         calm         click         clickety-clack         clink         crack         crackle         crash         din         discord         dissonance         drone         echo         explosion faint          sound         fizz         gag         grate         hiss         howl         hullabaloo         hum         hush         jangle         kerplunk         knock         loud(ness)         lull         moan         muffle         murmur         mute         noise         pandemonium         peal <p>pit-a-pat         plink         pop         quaver         quiet         racket         rap         rat-a-tat         rattle         raucous         resonant         reverberate         ring         roar         rumble         rush of sound         rustle         screech         shrill         silence         snap</p> sonorous         sound         staccato         stifle         strident         stutter         swirl         swish         tap         thump         tick         toot         twang         uproar         vibration         whir         whistle         whiz         whoosh <p>   The same principles applied to other types of stems give rise    to a plethora of complex and subtle means for describing motions, paths, trajectories,    movement in situ, light emanation, reflection, consistency, texture, variation    in shape, visual complexity, etc.</p> <p> </p> 10.1.6 Note on the Absence of Lexico-Semantic \u201cClasses\u201d <p>It should be noted that in  previous versions of the language, formative roots were divided into lexico-semantic \u201cclasses\u201d designated by the phonological patterning of the root (there were 17 such classes in the original version of Ithkuil, ten such classes in Ilaksh). In the current version of the language, these lexico-semantic classes have been eliminated, as the author has realized that the establishment of such classes does not serve any real functional purpose in \u201creal-world\u201d spoken/written contexts; the ability to identify the semantic class of a stem does not sufficiently aid in understanding the stem\u2019s specific meaning. Therefore, the  assignment of phoneme patterns to roots in Ithkuil is now arbitrary.  While the astute reader will  note that many roots pertaining to a specific semantic notion (e.g., animals, plant and substance taxonomies, spatial position, etc.) still have similar phonological patterning, such patterning is nevertheless merely incidental and is without formal significance. </p> <p> </p> 10.2 DIMENSIONAL AND DESCRIPTIVE OPPOSITIONS <p>Another area of the lexicon where Western languages tend to    divide up reality into binary oppositions is the realm of spatial dimensions,    where pairs such as near/far, small/large, thin/thick, narrow/wide, tall/short,      light/heavy, hot/cold, etc. are commonplace. As with the perspective-based    oppositions seen in the preceding section, again Ithkuil lexico-semantics treats    such concepts in a wholly different way. Rather than lexicalize such concepts    as pairs of binary oppositions, Ithkuil delineates these qualities as varying      points along a continuous range. In other words, in Ithkuil you do not    say X is cold and Y is hot, but rather X has less temperature and Y has greater temperature. Similarly, one does not say A is      near to me and B is far from me, but rather the distance from        me to A (or proximity of A to me) is less than the distance from me          to B (or proximity of B to me). Note that the choice of translation for    the latter stem as either \u2018distance\u2019 or \u2018proximity\u2019    becomes arbitrary, as the real meaning of the Ithkuil formative is \u2018amount    of linear space separating one party from another.\u2019 Virtually all Western    descriptive and dimensional oppositions are similarly handled in Ithkuil as    mere variance in the quantity of a single quality, the degree of an attribute,    or the extent along a spatio-temporal range or continuum.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 10.3 SPATIAL POSITION AND ORIENTATION <p>Concepts of spatial position and orientation are expressed    very differently in Ithkuil as compared to Western languages such as English.    The three major differences are explained below, each of which will be explored    in detail in the sections which follow.</p> <p>1) Ithkuil does not employ prepositions; all notions of spatial    relationships, position, and orientation are designated by nominal/verbal formatives.</p> <p>2) While Western languages allow spatial/positional reference    to function autonomously irrespective of the speaker\u2019s cognitive or semantic    intent, Ithkuil subordinates spatial/positional reference at the lexico-semantic    level in deference to the cognitive or semantic purpose of an utterance. What    this means is that sentences describing spatial relationships or positional    reference are only used when the underlying intent of the speaker\u2019s utterance    is purely to specify spatial or positional reference information. If, in fact,    the underlying intent of the utterance is to show some functional or purposeful    relationship (where a spatial relationship is merely coincidental or consequential),    the Ithkuil sentence will describe this function or purpose, not the spatial    relationship. For example, in answer to the question Where\u2019s Billy? an English speaker might give answers such as (a) He\u2019s standing right      next to Sam, or (b) He\u2019s in bed, or (c) He\u2019s in        the bathtub. While each of these sentences gives spatial information, only    the first is truly intended to convey spatial information as its purpose, while    sentences (b) and (c) imply information that is, in fact, more relevant than    the spatial information given, e.g., sentence (b) could be restated as \u2018He\u2019s    sleeping (or sick),\u2019 while sentence (c) could be restated as \u2018He\u2019s    bathing.\u2019 An Ithkuil speaker would not utter sentences like (b) or (c)    in answer to the query about Billy, since he/she would assume the question Where\u2019s      Billy? is intended to inquire only about Billy\u2019s physical position    in absolute space. If the questioner had, in fact, been seeking non-spatial    information, he/she would have asked the Ithkuil equivalent of What\u2019s      Billy doing? or What\u2019s happening with Billy? to which a    Ithkuil speaker would answer with sentences corresponding to the rephrased versions    of (b) or (c), not their original versions.</p> <p>3) Ithkuil utilizes an absolute coordinate system of comparative    spacial reference, not a relative one as found in most languages. Note the positional    ambiguity inherent in sentences such as He\u2019s standing to the left      of the desk. To be meaningful, the listener must first determine from whose    perspective the speaker is referring (i.e., do we mean the speaker\u2019s left,    the addressee\u2019s left, the desk\u2019s left relative to the position of    the speaker, the desk\u2019s left relative to the position of the addressee,    or the desk\u2019s left relative to the direction the desk is oriented/facing?)    Such ambiguity occurs because Western languages employ a relative coordinate    system which can shift from one participant or referent object to another. Ithkuil    spatial reference employs an absolute coordinate system independent of the perspective    of a participant (e.g., the speaker or addressee) or referent object (i.e.,    the thing(s) whose position is being described), as opposed to the relative    coordinate system found in Western languages. The Ithkuil system allows listeners    to understand exactly the spatial relationship and orientation of any object(s)    in absolute space, irrespective of anyone\u2019s (or anything\u2019s) personal    perspective. </p>    10.3.1 Formatives vs. Prepositions <p>Besides lexically \u201cpartitioning\u201d the world of two-    and three-dimensional space in different ways than in Western languages, Ithkuil    has no prepositions. Rather, Ithkuil utilizes formatives which describe a spatial    relationship between two objects or between an object and an associated background,    the nearest translations being a noun meaning \u201cthe area X\u201d or a    verb meaning \u201cto be positioned X\u201d, where X corresponds to a Western    preposition or positional adverb such as \u201cin\u201d or \u201cinside.\u201d</p> <p> </p>  10.3.2 Underlying Cognitive Purpose of an Utterance <p>Ithkuil grammar considers the functional relationship between    two objects to be primarily relevant, not their spatial orientation or position    relative to each other (or between an object and its background). When it comes    to describing an object against a background or the relationship between two    objects, Ithkuil grammar is more interested in answering the question How      do X and Y function relative to each other, rather than How are X and        Y positioned in space relative to each other? </p> <p>For example: in uttering the English sentence The vase    is on the table, is the intention of the sentence to tell the listener    the physical coordinate position of the vase in 3-D space relative to the table,    or to tell the listener that the vase is being physically supported (i.e., against    gravity) by the table? If the intention is the former, the corresponding Ithkuil    sentence would indeed utilize a spatial formative translatable as \u2018manifest    self on the top side of a surface that is horizontal relative to the direction    of gravity.\u2019 However, if the intention is to actually indicate support    against gravity, the Ithkuil sentence would not utilize a spatial reference    at all, but rather translate the sentence more or less as The table is supporting      the vase. As a result, spatial, locative, or orientational formatives in    Ithkuil are used far less often than corresponding prepositions and spatial    constructions in English or other Western languages. Note the following examples    illustrating how various English sentences utilizing the concept \u2018in\u2019    (meaning \u2018inside\u2019 or \u2018into\u2019) are translated into Ithkuil    using various non-spatial roots based on reason or purpose.</p> ENGLISH        SENTENCE  CONCEPT        CORRESPONDING TO 'IN(SIDE or INTO)'  NEAREST        TRANSLATION TO Ithkuil EQUIVALENT The man works in(side) that building. general locational        reference where idea of interiority or containment is incidental The man works at that building.

However, it does so in ways that are very unfamiliar in    terms of Western grammar. These are described in the following section.</p>    10.3.3 Absolute vs. Relative Spatial/Positional Coordinates <p>While Western languages are capable of describing the physical    position and orientation of object in absolute terms (e.g., My hometown      is located at 93\u00b041'36\"W by 43\u00b012'55\"N), it is not normal    to do so in general parlance. Rather, Western spatial position and orientation    is normally relative, i.e., described from the dynamic perspective of the two    objects themselves or from the perspective of a third party observer (usually,    but not exclusively, the speaker). Therefore, if I describe the position of    objects in my backyard to you on the telephone, and you have never seen my backyard,    phrases such as \u2018the swingset is against the wall,\u2019 \u2018the barbecue    is sitting to my right,\u2019 \u2018the elm tree is behind the shed\u2019    and \u2018the rose bush is beyond the bird fountain\u2019 convey little information    without first having to establish a common frame of reference based on where    the speaker is positioned relative to the edges of the yard (in order to interpret    what he means by \u2018beyond the fountain\u2019), which way he is facing    relative to the yard (in order to interpret what he means by \u2018to my right\u2019),    perhaps even the orientation of the shape of the yard relative to some external    absolute system of orientation (e.g., the four cardinal directions N, S, E,    W).</p> <p>In such a relative scheme concepts such as \u2018to my right\u2019    change completely if I turn my body 180 degrees. Confusion also occurs when    I say \u2018to the left of the chair.\u2019 Do I mean to the left side of    the chair from my (the speaker\u2019s) perspective? Or do I mean to the left    side of the chair from the perspective of someone sitting in the chair?</p> <p>Ithkuil avoids such confusions by being based on an absolute    coordinate system of spatial reference as opposed to a relative system (similar    in nature to the absolute system used in navigation based on the four cardinal    points.). Very few languages on Earth utilize such absolute systems to the exclusion    of relative systems. (Examples include Guugu Yimidhirr, an Australian aboriginal    language; Tzeltal, a Yucatec Mayan language; and Yurok, an Algonquian Indian    language of Northern California). Ithkuil utilizes three different absolute    coordinate schemes, each functioning within a different speech context. These    coordinate systems establish a three-dimensional right-angled coordinate grid    superimposed upon space, with the X-axis reckoned from a line perpendicular    to the direction of gravity (which, for practical purposes, we may term \u201chorizontal\u201d),    the Z-axis reckoned by a line corresponding to the direction of gravity (which    may be termed the \u201cvertical\u201d) and the all-important Y-axis (which    differentiates a relative system from an absolute) derived from one of three    points of reckoning depending on which coordinate scheme is being utilized.    The three schemes are as follows:</p> <p>1) Solar-based system. This is the standard    Ithkuil system of reckoning. The line of the Y-axis runs parallel to the rising    and setting points of the sun in mid-summer, with the vector oriented in the    direction of the setting sun. Note that the alignment of this Y-axis relative    to the X-axis is variable; i.e., the line connecting the rising and setting    points of the sun merely designate the direction of the Y-axis, not    it actual position. This is necessary so that descriptions of spatial relationships    can be made using a \u201coctant locator\u201d system based on this grid,    where any two objects can be made to lie within different octants relative    to each other (this will be illustrated below). </p> <p>Use of this solar-based reckoning system continues at nighttime    and on overcast or rainy days, based on society\u2019s collective knowledge    and/or recollection of landmarks indicating the rising and setting points of    the sun. Use of this system even continues indoors if there exists a collective    understanding of the orientation of the building/structure/room relative to    the solar-based Y-axis (i.e., everyone in the room can still tell the orientation    of the outdoor Y-axis, whether by sight through windows, or by noticing that    the length-width ratios of the room are aligned with the outdoor Y-axis).</p> <p>2) Length vs. width of enclosed space or room.    In indoor situations where the orientation of the outdoor solar-based Y-axis    is unknown (or cannot be readily determined on a continuous basis as new speakers    enter the room), an arbitrary Y-axis is connoted by the length of the room in    a direction away from whichever end of the room displays a visibly unique feature    (e.g., the doorway, a window, an alcove, an imposing piece of furniture, a stage    or dais, etc.), this symbolically substituting for the position of the rising    sun. This is the coordinate system which would be employed in theaters, enclosed    banquet halls without windows, and cellars without windows or ready access to    outside orientation.</p> <p>3) Arbitrarily delineated axis based on local landmarks,    objects, or persons. This is similar to a Western relative system in    which the speaker announces the orientation perspective being utilized. An Ithkuil    speaker would consider this a highly unusual and \u201caffected\u201d method    of reckoning. Nevertheless, it is possible to designate a personally defined    reckoning system using words to designate the origin point and direction of    the Y-axis vector, examples translatable by such phrases as \u2018based on    a vector from me to that large window\u2019 or \u2018based on a vector between    the shed and the big oak tree.\u2019 In fact, this is the purpose of the NAVIGATIVE case (see Sec. 4.7.6).    The primary use for this system of reckoning is literary or narrative, such    as when a speaker tells a story of another time and place, in which he/she wishes    to describe spatial relationships solely within the context of the story in    order to convey a mental map or image of the goings-on to his/her audience.</p> <p> 10.3.3.1 Describing Spatial Relationships between Two or More Objects.    Using such a triaxial three-dimensional grid, Ithkuil then lexically divides    up space into \u201coctants\u201d, four quadrants to each given \u201chemisphere\u201d    of absolute space delineated by the three axes, for a total of eight octants.</p> <p> +X / +Y / +Z = \u201cright / ahead / above\u201d = Octant      1 = Root: -KST-     +X / +Y / -Z = \u201cright / ahead / below\u201d = Octant 2 = Root: -K\u0160T-     +X / -Y / +Z = \u201cright / behind / above\u201d = Octant 3 = Root: -PST-     +X / -Y / -Z = \u201cright / behind / below\u201d = Octant 4 = Root: -P\u0160T-     -X / +Y / +Z = \u201cleft / ahead / above\u201d = Octant 5 = Root: -KSP-     -X / +Y / -Z = \u201cleft / ahead / below\u201d = Octant 6 = Root: -K\u0160P-     -X / -Y / +Z = \u201cleft / behind / above\u201d = Octant 7 = Root: -PSK-     -X / -Y / -Z = \u201cleft / behind / below\u201d = Octant 8 = Root: -P\u0160K-</p> <p>   There are eighteen additional roots corresponding to the above    where either one or two of the X/Y/Z values are zero, indicating concepts equivalent    English phrases such as \u2018neither above nor below,\u2019 \u2018straight    down,\u2019 \u2018straight ahead,\u2019 \u2018directly behind,\u2019 \u2018straight    up,\u2019 \u2018on the same plane as,\u2019 etc. </p> <p>The SSD suffix in turn is used to specify translative movement from a starting octant specified by the stem toward an endpoint specified by the suffix, as follows:</p> Degree 1 moving toward Octant        1 Degree 2 moving toward Octant         2 Degree 3 moving toward Octant         3 Degree 4 moving toward Octant         4 Degree 5 moving toward a position between octants, (i.e., either X = 0, Y = 0, or Z = 0) Degree 6 moving toward Octant       5 Degree 7 moving toward Octant       6 Degree 8  moving toward Octant       7 Degree 9 moving toward Octant         8 <p> </p> <p>Additionally, the LCT suffix is used with these roots to identify the location of objects within a specific octant. The above octants are    indicated in the illustrations below.</p> <p>Because the lateral alignment (but not direction) of the solar-based    X and Y-axes are variable (i.e., each can be slid laterally relative to the    other axis), any two objects whose relative positions are to be described can    be made to fall within two different octants, as illustrated in figures A,    B, C and D below (Figure A represents the background context for which Figures    B, C and D present varying positional frames of reference). </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> It is the ability to \u201cslide\u201d the axes of this three-dimensional    grid that allows Ithkuil to easily describe the relative position of objects    in an absolute manner. Because the grid can be arranged so that any two objects    each fall into different octants, a series of octant-to-octant relationships    between the two objects can be lexified. Thus, each of the above roots has a    stem which, in conjunction with a set of affixes, designates a spatial relationship    between an object occupying that octant and a second object occupying any    of the seven other octants. For the purpose of this analysis, we will call    each of these octant-to-octant static relationships a \u201cpositional    frame.\u201d (the leftover affixes refer to (1) 1st object in motion while    2nd object at rest, and (2) 2nd object in motion while first object at rest.    Used to mark the participant nouns with motion sentences described below.) </p> <p>Additionally, such a positional reference system allows a speaker    to describe exactly the spatial relationships between two objects in motion relative    to each other. This is done in Ithkuil by stating that two object are moving    from positional frame A toward positional frame B. If one remembers that, by    \u201cpositional frame\u201d we mean a spatial relationship between two objects,    not a specific location in space, it can be seen how such a simple formula easily    describes the relative trajectories of two objects. An Ithkuil speaker is describing    exactly how two objects are moving through space by stating in one short sentence    the octant-to-octant relationship the two objects have to start with, and    the octant-to-octant relationship they will have when the motion is ended.    The root used to describe the motion indicates the nature of the motion in terms    of its smoothness, speed, etc.</p> <p>To insert a third party into a positional frame (such as describing    where the speaker or addressee or third party is situated relative to the two    objects described in the positional frame) a case-frame clause is added to the    sentence in the concursive case (\u201cwhile/during/at the time of\u201d)    which states the positional frame between that third party and the FIRST party    (unless the 2nd party is overtly specified). Example: \u201cThe dog and the    ball M\u2019d while the cat N\u2019d,\u201d where M is the positional frame    of the dog and ball and N is the positional frame between the cat and dog.</p> <p>Based on the above, we can see just how exact Ithkuil can be    in describing relative position between objects in an absolute manner. This    is best illustrated by narrowly translating into English an Ithkuil sentence    which describes a three-party positional situation. </p> <p> </p> <p>     Qi\u2019\u00ealafs\u00a0 \u00e2mmul\u00a0 \u00e2hiogwokstat\u00fckai  \u00a0\u00edxi\u2019asa\u00a0  a\u00e7t<sup>h</sup>u\u00a0 p\u0161t\u00e2\u2019at.

However, a more exact, narrow translation    of this sentence, capturing all of the positional/orientational specificity    of the original, would run as follows:  </p> <p>As the woman held still,  the boy ran from      a position above, ahead of, and to the right of her relative to the direction      of the sunrise-to-sunset vector, a plane perpendicular to it, and the axis      of gravity, toward a position still above, but behind and to the left of her      relative to the same directional vector, perpendicular plane and gravitational      axis, as I was watching them from below, behind, and to the right of her relative      to the same vector, plane, and axis. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 10.4 LEXICAL GENERALIZATION <p>In a word-for-word comparison to a Eurocentric vocabulary,    especially one as large as that of English, the Ithkuil lexicon appears very    overgeneralized in many respects. At first impression, it appears that shades    of meaning expressed by multiple words in English are expressed by only one    root in Ithkuil. As we have seen repeatedly throughout this work, this is primarily    due to the fact that shades of meaning for a single underlying cognitive concept    are normally differentiated at the morphological level in Ithkuil, as opposed    to the lexical. Nevertheless, there are several lexico-semantic areas where    Ithkuil truly does generalize in comparison to Western languages. This occurs    primarily where (1) Western vocabulary distinguishes separate lexemes for a    redundant concept based on different participants to, practitioners of, or manifestations    of that concept, and (2) where lexification is at an arbitrarily detailed or    particularized level. These topics are discussed in detail in the following    sections.</p>    10.4.1 Consolidation of Unnecessary Distinctions <p>As an example of lexical generalization in Ithkuil (or over-lexicalization    in English!), compare the following words for animal vocal sounds: meow,      bark, whinny, chirp, moo, bray, etc. Each of these words mean merely to    make one\u2019s species-specific inherent vocal sound. Ithkuil utilizes only    a single stem for this concept (essentially meaning vocal sound/vocalize \u2013 from the same root which gives the stem for (human) voice),    based on the logical assumption that, since cats can\u2019t bark, whinny or    moo, and dogs can\u2019t meow, whinny or moo, there is no need to differentiate    lexically the innate vocal sound being made by an animal if the animal making    the sound is identified in the sentence. Of course, one might argue that English    allows for metaphorical or similative application of such words, as in The      sergeant barked out orders to the platoon, or The baby squealed in        delight. Such constructions are perfectly captured in Ithkuil via the ESSIVE and ASSIMILATIVE cases, as in He \u2018vocalized\u2019 the orders like a dog, or The          baby \u2018vocalized\u2019 like a baby piglet from feeling delight, or  via the manipulation of Function, Incorporation and Format (see Sections 5.1 and 6.4).</p> <p>Similar series of English words which reduce to a single stem    in Ithkuil would be (1) herd, flock, pride, gaggle, etc.; (2) hair,      fur, fleece, coat, etc.; (3) skin, hide, pelt, pellicle, peel, rind,        lambskin, leather, integument, etc.</p> <p> </p>  10.4.2 Translative Motion, Paths and Trajectories <p>By translative motion is meant the idea of an object moving    (or being moved) from one location to another. English is particularly rich    in its vocabulary to describe the various paths or trajectories of such an object,    not only in regard to the \u201cshape\u201d or form of the path or trajectory,    but also the means of initiating the movement. Thus we have terms such as to      toss, throw, pitch, hurl, fling, roll, run, or pass a ball or    other object. In reaching its destination, the object can fly, float, wing,      pass, arc, sail, plummet, drop, fall, thread, hop, leap, bounce, roll, zig-zag,      slide, glide, slither, or jump its way there.</p> <p>As we have seen to be the case in other contexts, Ithkuil lexifies    concepts of translative motion with a focus on the contexts of purpose and outcome,    not on the \u201cinnate structure\u201d of the event as an end in itself.    Essentially, Ithkuil is less concerned with how the object gets there and is    more concerned about why it\u2019s going there and whether it arrives. For    example, look at the following two columns of English sentences :</p> <p>I tossed it into            the basket.</p> It sailed          into the basket. <p>I flung it into the            basket.</p> It flew into the basket. <p>I hurled it into            the basket.</p> It arced its way into          the basket. <p>I pitched it into            the basket.</p> It fell into the basket. <p> The sentences in the lefthand column    describes how I initiate the action while those in the righthand column describe    how the object moves. In Ithkuil the lefthand column of sentences would normally    all be translated by a single sentence narrowly translatable as I made it      end up inside the basket, while the righthand column of sentences would    all be translated by the exact same sentence minus the ERGATIVE personal referent I, thus: It ended up inside the basket.</p> <p>So where are the words translating the range of descriptive    nuance surrounding the means of sending it into the basket and the different    trajectories it takes there? In normal Ithkuil speech, such distinctions would    be considered irrelevant. This is because Ithkuil grammar questions all acts,    conditions and events as to their underlying cognitive purpose. For the above    sentences, Ithkuil views them as all having the same underlying purpose: to    express that I have caused an object to pass from a state of being in my alienable    possession to a state of being within the basket, by passing through the physical    space between me and the basket. Therefore there is only one translation for    the varying sentence pairs.</p> <p>Before the reader begins to think that Ithkuil is incapable    of distinguishing the shades of meaning present in the above examples, it should    be noted that such distinctions can be easily rendered by additional affixes    and words describing these concepts. For example, if it is truly necessary to    indicate that the object was \u201cflung\u201d into the basket, Ithkuil can    augment the sentence I made it end up inside the basket to include    affixes which indicate use of the hand in a sudden recoil-like motion plus affixes    indicating forceful and rapid arrival into the basket, the result being narrowly    translatable as Using my hand in a sudden, subtle, recoil-like motion I      caused it to move quickly away and end up forcefully inside the basket.</p> <p>While this would more or less accurately capture the nuances    of English \u201cflung,\u201d Ithkuil first makes us stop and ask ourselves,    why is it even necessary to describe the details of the trajectory and the force    initiating it? After all, in a normal everyday contextual setting, if an English    speaker were to use the verb \u201ctossed\u201d or \u201cthrew\u201d or    \u201cplaced\u201d or \u201cput\u201d instead of \u201cflung\u201d in    the above sentence, would his/her speaker be considered to have been given information    any less sufficient or essential for understanding the message and its purpose?    All of which again illustrates the dynamism of Ithkuil lexico-semantics: if    a complex, highly detailed morphology already conveys a high degree of semantic    and cognitive nuance, why belabor the obvious by reinforcing such nuances at    the lexical level if the context and underlying cognitive purpose of the utterance    does not require it? Thus the Ithkuil language not only captures levels of cognitive    detail beyond the scope of Western languages, but it also allows the speaker    to avoid having to provide such detail when it is inessential.</p> <p> </p>  10.4.3 No Lexification of Specific Instances of Underlying    Processes <p>In regard to over-lexification in English from a Ithkuil perspective,    an example would be limp, as in \u2018to walk with a limp.\u2019    Ithkuil recognizes that, in observing a person walking with a limp, it is not    the condition per se that is relevant, but rather the manner in which    the condition causes the person to move, i.e. asymmetrically, irregularly, discontinuously    in an unexpected way inconsistent with a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d    expectation of walking. Ithkuil speakers would consider English limp to represent an arbitrarily specific occurrence of an underlying state of translative    movement. To a Ithkuil speaker, what is important is the way the person moves.    The idea that a person continues to \u201chave a limp\u201d even when sleeping    or sitting is considered absurd. What the person \u201ccontinues to have\u201d    is an underlying physical injury, abnormality, disability, illness, or deformity    which causes the person to move asymmetrically when walking. Therefore, instead    of He has a limp because of his war wound, a Ithkuil speaker would    say He walks asymmetrically/irregularly because of his war wound. </p> <p>To illustrate this by analogy, consider a person who, when    dancing to rock music, has a tendency to jerk his/her head to the left at the    sound of the downbeat. Most English speakers would consider it ludicrous over-lexicalization    to propose a verb \u201cspreggle\u201d meaning \u2018to jerk one\u2019s    head to the left on the downbeat when dancing,\u2019 as in the hypothetical    sentence She spreggles to rock music. Yet, from the Ithkuil standpoint,    there is no difference in arbitrariness between the hypothetical \u201cspreggle\u201d    and the actual word \u2018limp.\u2019</p> <p>Based on a combination of the above reasoning surrounding both    animal vocal sounds and \u2018limp,\u2019 Ithkuil has no words for \u2018blind(ness),\u2019    \u2018deaf(ness),\u2019 \u2018mute(ness),\u2019 \u2018dementia,\u2019    or \u2018paralysis.\u2019 In Ithkuil, one simply says He can\u2019t see,      She can\u2019t hear, She can\u2019t speak, He can\u2019t think, He can\u2019t      move, or alternately His faculty of sight (or other sense or innate    faculty) doesn\u2019t function/no longer functions. [Note: each of    these sentences would, of course, employ appropriate morphological markers,    case, voice, degrees of affixes, etc. to indicate the extent of functional loss,    whether temporary or permanent, whether increasing or decreasing, whether externally    caused or inherently developed, etc.]</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 10.5 LEXICAL DIFFERENTIATION <p>While we have examined the many ways in which the dynamism    and logic of Ithkuil grammar eliminates whole swaths of equivalent English vocabulary,    there are, nevertheless, many concepts where Ithkuil provides autonomous lexical    roots and stems for which neither English nor other Western languages provide    similar words and must resort to paraphrase in order to translate. Such concepts    are particularly found in the realm of human emotions, social relationships,    functional interrelationships between objects, philosophy, psychology, and sensory    phenomena. </p> <p>Underlying such differentiation is the idea that the Ithkuil    language is meant to reflect in linguistic terms as close a representation of    human cognition and pre-linguistic epistemological categorization as is possible    in language without resorting to outright linguistic representations of pure    mathematical logic. Since the inner mental life of the speaker is often clouded    in vagueness or artificial \u201csurface\u201d categories once represented    in spoken languages such as English and other Eurocentric languages, a language    which is focused on representing that inner mental life will necessarily require    many more words to describe that life than are commonly available in existing    human languages. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 10.6 COMPARISON TO WESTERN CATEGORIZATION <p>Western languages have several words and/or concepts for which    there is no exactly corresponding equivalent in Ithkuil. These include the concepts    embodied in the verb \u201cto be\u201d and \u201cto have.\u201d Ithkuil    has no way of truly expressing copula identification corresponding to \u201cbe\u201d    or \u201cbeing\u201d, nor any direct translation of possession or ownership    equivalent to \u201chave.\u201d Essentially this is because Ithkuil grammar    and lexico-semantics do not recognize inherent existential identification or    inherent existential possession as true semantic functional categories or fundamental    cognitive primitives.</p>    10.6.1 Translating \u201cTo Be\u201d <p>Ithkuil grammar inherently recognizes that the universe is,    at any and all moments, and on all scales large and small, in a state of flux.    The idea that any given entity can be permanently or innately identified as    \u201cbeing\u201d some other entity is considered nonsensical. Ithkuil grammar    has no way of clearly indicating any such notions as \u201cbeing\u201d or    \u201cto be,\u201d as the universe is a universe of actions or states that    are the results of actions. Even states, as such, are in flux and different    from moment to moment, if only because the mere passage of time itself renders    the \u201cstatic\u201d condition different than it was the moment before.    Therefore, one cannot \u201cbe\u201d anything else, or for that matter \u201cbe\u201d    anything at all. Rather, one \u201cdoes\u201d or \u201cfunctions as\u201d    or \u201cfulfills a role as\u201d or \u201cmanifests itself as\u201d something    else. Fundamental to Ithkuil grammar are the notions of function and purpose,    not mere description; results, not mere means; manifestation, not mere existence.    This explains why there is no true distinction between nouns and verbs in Ithkuil,    both being mere differences in functional roles played by any given formative    concept whose underlying meaning is not inherently nominal or verbal, but rather    a conceptual primitive waiting to be manifested as either (1) a representation    of an action, process, or event, (i.e., a verb), or (2) as a concrete or abstract    entity that is representative of, or embodies the underlying concept (i.e.,    a noun).</p> <p>So, an Ithkuil speaker does not say I am John, She is a    cook, The leaf is green, Stan is ill, or Murder is wrong, but    rather One calls me John, She cooks [for a living], The leaf [currently]      manifests a green color, Stan feels ill [or carries a disease], and Murder        controverts morality.</p> <p> </p> 10.6.2 Translating \u2018To Have\u2019 <p>In regard to \u201chave\u201d or \u201chaving,\u201d Ithkuil    views the concept of possession as breaking down into more specific functional    states and categories, each operating independently and having little relation    to each other. The neutral, default way of expressing \u201cto have\u201d involves placing the possessor in the DATIVE case and utilizing the MANIFESTIVE function of the verb, so that the phrase \u201cI have a book\u201d translates more or less as \u201cThere is a book to me.\u201d </p>  10.6.3 \u2018Yes,\u2019 \u2018No\u2019 and Other Interjections <p>As there are no interjections in Ithkuil, there are no true    equivalents to \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in Ithkuil. Nevertheless,  Ithkuil grammar also allows for the use of Bias suffixes (see Sec. 5.11) to function    as autonomous words to convey attitudes and emotional responses similarly to    interjections in Western languages. This phenomenon has already been discussed    in Section 8.4.    Additionally, Section      8.3 described how affixual adjuncts may be used to convey information similarly    to autonomous interjections.</p> 10.6.4  \u201cWH\u201d-Questions <p>Ithkuil has no equivalent to WH-question words such  as what? where? when? why? how? etc.\u00a0  Instead, statements are made using DIRECTIVE illocution (and hopefully SOLICITIVE bias) to provide the  desired information.\u00a0 Thus, instead of  asking \u201cWhere is the toilet?\u201d or \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d one says \u201cPlease state the  toilet\u2019s location\u201d and \u201cPlease identify yourself.\u201d </p>   10.6.5 Translating Metaphorically Structured Phrases  <p>Ithkuil grammar recognizes that much of our understanding and    expression of everyday experience is structured in terms of metaphor and metonymy    (the latter being the reference to an entity by one of its attributes, associations    or activities, as in The ham-and-cheese wants fries with      his order or The White House has its nose in our business).    Ithkuil allows for the overt designation of metaphorical concepts by several    means. These include the REPRESENTATIONAL context, stem incorporation,    the metonymic MET  affix    -qt,    and the two part-whole      PTF and PTG suffixes -rs and -\u0161.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"11/","title":"11 Script","text":"A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 11: The Writing System   The Ithkuil script is a morpho-phonemic script, i.e., the  individual characters do not simply convey phonetic (i.e., phonological)  information, but also convey grammatical (i.e., morphological)  information.\u00a0 Many of the characters are  purely morphological in function and without any set phonological value, their  specific phonological interpretation being up to the reader based on the  flexiblility and options inherent in Ithkuil morpho-phonology.\u00a0  11.1 CHARACTER TYPES <p>There are four  types of characters used in the Ithkuil  Script: Primary Case/Aspect characters, Secondary Case/Aspect characters, Tertiary characters, and Consonantal characters. Additionally, there are symbols used for numbers (to be discussed in Chapter 12), separate rules for transliterating non-Ithkuil words alphabetically, and a few punctuation symbols.</p> <p></p> <p>11.1.1 Primary Case/Aspect Markers</p> <p>If present, the Case-Marker character is the  first written character in a word.\u00a0 It is  normally used  to convey the case or case-frame of a formative, however, when  the case or case-frame of the formative is the OBLIQUE, it can instead be used  to convey one of the following: Aspect, Modality, Validation, or Valence.\u00a0 In addition to these categories, the  character also shows the following categories:\u00a0  Configuration, Essence, Affiliation, Extension, Mood, and Version.</p> <p>Primary Case/Aspect characters are recognizable by the  absence of a top or bottom horizontal bar (as is found on all consonantal  characters below), as well as a diagonal section of the character either below  or above the horizontal mid-line.\u00a0 This  diagonal section of the character will always change direction at the  horizontal midline of the character.\u00a0  Examples:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> 11.1.2\u00a0 Secondary  Case/Aspect Markers</p> <p>As stated above,  Primary Case markers can be used to convey only one of the following categories  at a time:\u00a0 Case, Aspect, Modality,  Validation, or Valence.\u00a0 However, it is  often necessary to be able to show more than one of these categories on a  formative (i.e., the formative has non-default values for more than one of  these categories).\u00a0 In such cases,  secondary Case/Aspect Markers can be used.\u00a0  These characters are capable of showing Case, Aspect, and Modality  simultaneously.\u00a0 Additionally, they can  be used to show non-default values for the categories of Phase, Sanction,  Designation, and Perspective. </p> <p>Secondary Case/Aspect markers can be recognized by the  presence of a diagonal bar extending the entire length of the character from  the top-line (or even above the top-line) all the way to the bottom-line (or  even below the bottom-line).\u00a0 This  diagonal bar may be broken or modified in the middle by either a horizontal or  vertical zig-zag, but will always continue in the same direction as before  coming out of the break or zig-zag (unlike Primary Case/Aspect characters which   have a change in direction beginning at the horizontal mid-line).\u00a0 Examples:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>11.1.3 Tertiary Characters</p> <p>These characters are used, when necessary, to convey the combination of  two different aspects, aspect plus modality, aspect plus valence, aspect plus  validation, validation plus modality, valence plus modality, or valence plus  validation.\u00a0 They are recognizable by  having a horizontal bar at the mid-line of the character which is not connected  to any vertical or diagonal bars above or below the horizontal bar.\u00a0 The ends of the horizontal bar may be  modified by points facing upward or downward. Examples:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>11.1.4 Consonantal Characters</p> <p>These characters are used to convey the consonantal root Cr, the  incorporated root Cx (if present), and any Vx-C consonantal suffixes the  formative may have.\u00a0 They are placed  following any characters of Types 1, 2, or 3, in the order (Cx)-Cr-(VxC)-(VxC...  etc.)\u00a0 If an incorporated root Cx is  present, it is indicated by vertically inverting the Consonantal character in  order to distinguish it from the following Cr character.\u00a0 The Cr character is also used to convey the  categories of Function, Format, Context, Illocution, and Relation, while the  VxC character conveys affix type and degree, as well as Bias.</p> <p>Consonantal characters are recognizable\u00a0 by the presence of a horizontal bar either  along the top-line or the bottom-line, the ends of which may be modified. Examples:</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.1.5 Example of the Script in Operation</p> <p>To illustrate further how a morpho-phonemic script operates,  we can analyze the function of each character  in the following Ithkuil  sentence:</p> <p> </p> <p>Igrawilei\u0163rar \u00a0oi\u00a0 eglul\u00f4n.

ANALYSIS OF THE  CHARACTER TYPES <p>The sub-sections below provide the details of the various  characters and character-permutations associated with each character type.</p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.1 Primary Case/Aspect Characters</p> <p>The neutral default shape for a  Primary Case/Aspect character is as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 </p> <p>This shape can then be mutated into a variety of derivative  shapes by means of changing the direction of the bars of the character at the  mid-line point, extending the mid-line point horizontally, and changing the  corner-like vertices to \u201coffset\u201d connections, as illustrated by the examples  in Section 11.1.1 above:</p> <p>The common recognizable elements in any Primary Case/Aspect  character, and what distinguishes such characters from the other three  character-types, are (1) the absence of a horizontal bar along the top-line and  the bottom-line, (2) a diagnonal bar running from the mid-line to either the  top-line or to the bottom-line or both, and (3) a change in the diagonal  bar\u2019s\u00a0 (or bars\u2019) direction at the  mid-line.</p> <p>A Primary Case/Aspect character usually conveys the case of  the formative (see Chapter 4), however, in the absence of case (e.g., as with a verb), or when  the case is OBLIQUE, the character can convey one of the following other  categories:\u00a0 Aspect, Modality, Valence,  or Validation.</p> <p>The various ways the character conveys these categories is  described below.</p> <p>(NOTE:\u00a0 If a formative  is the first word in a sentence and carries no Aspect or Modality, and the  other five categories are in their neutral/default modes (i.e., MNO valence,  CNF validation, PRC version, CTX phase, and PPS sanction), then the Primary  Aspect/Modality character will be missing, i.e., is not written.)</p> <p>11.3.1.1 Case:\u00a0 The 96 cases are shown by the main body of  the character \u2013 there are 24 basic forms corresponding to the first 24  cases.\u00a0 The next group of 24 cases  utilizes the same 24 forms laterally reversed.\u00a0  The latter 48 cases utilize these same forms, vertically reversed.\u00a0 These forms are shown below (note that the  vertical symmetricality of Forms 1 and 25, as well as Forms 3 and 27, require  that Forms 49, 51, 73, and 75 have special forms):</p> <p>   Table 35: Primary Case characters (Note that for the purposes of this table, the VOCATIVE case is shown in Position No. 48.)</p> <p>1 OBL</p> <p></p> <p>25 PUR</p> <p></p> <p>49 EXC</p> <p></p> <p>73 CMP1A</p> <p></p> <p>2 IND</p> <p></p> <p>26 CSD</p> <p></p> <p>50 AVR</p> <p></p> <p>74 CMP1B</p> <p></p> <p>3 ABS</p> <p></p> <p>27 ESS</p> <p></p> <p>51 CMP</p> <p></p> <p>75 CMP1C</p> <p></p> <p>4 ERG</p> <p></p> <p>28 ASI</p> <p></p> <p>52 SML</p> <p></p> <p>76 CMP1D</p> <p></p> <p>5 EFF</p> <p></p> <p>29 FUN</p> <p></p> <p>53 ASS</p> <p></p> <p>77 CMP1E</p> <p></p> <p>6 AFF</p> <p></p> <p>30 TFM</p> <p></p> <p>54 CNR</p> <p></p> <p>78 CMP1F</p> <p></p> <p>7 DAT</p> <p></p> <p>31 REF</p> <p></p> <p>55 ACS</p> <p></p> <p>79 CMP1G</p> <p></p> <p>8 INS</p> <p></p> <p>32 CLA</p> <p></p> <p>56 DFF</p> <p></p> <p>80 CMP1H</p> <p></p> <p>9 ACT</p> <p></p> <p>33 CNV</p> <p></p> <p>57 PER </p> <p></p> <p>81 CMP2A</p> <p></p> <p>10 DER</p> <p></p> <p>34 IDP</p> <p></p> <p>58 PRO</p> <p></p> <p>82 CMP2B</p> <p></p> <p>11 SIT</p> <p></p> <p>35 BEN</p> <p></p> <p>59 PCV</p> <p></p> <p>83 CMP2C</p> <p></p> <p>12 POS</p> <p></p> <p>36 TSP</p> <p></p> <p>60 PCR</p> <p></p> <p>84 CMP2D</p> <p></p> <p>13 PRP</p> <p></p> <p>37 CMM</p> <p></p> <p>61 ELP</p> <p></p> <p>85 CMP2E</p> <p></p> <p>14 GEN</p> <p></p> <p>38 COM</p> <p></p> <p>62 ALP</p> <p></p> <p>86 CMP2F</p> <p></p> <p>15 ATT</p> <p></p> <p>39 CNJ</p> <p></p> <p>63 INP</p> <p></p> <p>87 CMP2G</p> <p></p> <p>16 PDC</p> <p></p> <p>40 UTL</p> <p></p> <p>64 EPS</p> <p></p> <p>88 CMP2H</p> <p></p> <p>17 ITP</p> <p></p> <p>41 ABE</p> <p></p> <p>65 PRL</p> <p></p> <p>89 CMP3A</p> <p></p> <p>18 OGN</p> <p></p> <p>42 CVS</p> <p></p> <p>66 LIM</p> <p></p> <p>90 CMP3B</p> <p></p> <p>19 PAR</p> <p></p> <p>43 COR</p> <p></p> <p>67 LOC</p> <p></p> <p>91 CMP3C</p> <p></p> <p>20 CRS</p> <p></p> <p>44 DEP</p> <p></p> <p>68 ORI</p> <p></p> <p>92 CMP3D</p> <p></p> <p>21 CPS</p> <p></p> <p>45 PVS</p> <p></p> <p>69 PSV</p> <p></p> <p>93 CMP3E</p> <p></p> <p>22 PRD</p> <p></p> <p>46 PTL</p> <p></p> <p>70 ALL</p> <p></p> <p>94 CMP3F</p> <p></p> <p>23 MED</p> <p></p> <p>47 CON</p> <p></p> <p>71 ABL</p> <p></p> <p>95 CMP3G</p> <p></p> <p>24 APL</p> <p></p> <p>48 VOC</p> <p></p> <p>72 NAV</p> <p></p> <p>96 CMP3H </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.1.2 Configuration and  Essence:\u00a0 These two categories (see Sections 3.1 and 3.5) are  shown via modifications to the top \u201cend\u201d of the Primary Case/Aspect character,  as shown below:</p> <p>     Table 36: Modifications to Primary Case/Aspect Characters Indicating Configuration &amp;

In addition, high-toned personal reference adjuncts carry an underposed dot diacritic on the same Primary Case/Aspect character. (The presence of the superposed horizontal bar diacritic on the character prevents this underposed dot from being confused with Version marking explained in the section immediately below.)</p> <p>11.3.1.6 Version:\u00a0\u00a0 This category (see Section 5.8) is shown via an underposed  diacritic below the Primary Case/Aspect character.\u00a0 These diacritics come in two varieties,  standard and alternate.\u00a0 Use of the alternate  form of the diacritic indicates that the main body of the character conveys a  category other than Case (explained below in Section 11.3.1.7).</p> <p>     Table 40: Diacritics on Primary Case/Aspect Characters Indicating Version</p> <p> </p> <p>1 PRC</p> <p>2 CPT</p> <p>3 INE</p> <p>4 INC</p> <p>5 PST</p> <p>6 EFC</p> <p>standard</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>alternate</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.1.7 Aspect, Modality, Valence  and Validation:\u00a0 If the underposed  version diacritic shown on a Primary Case/Aspect character is in an alternate  form (as shown in Table 40 above), then the main body of the character no longer  conveys the category of Case, but rather one of the following four categories: \u00a0Aspect, Modality, Valence, or Validation,  depending on which character is displayed (see Sections 5.10, 6.1, 5.7, and 5.9 respectively, for explanations of these categories).\u00a0  The characters normally reserved for Case Nos. 1 through 32 instead  indicate the 32 aspects.

The values in the table below show an inverted \u2018t\u2019 consonantal character representing the incorporated root, followed by a standard \u2018t\u2019 consonantal character representing the main root. The pattern of diacritics is shown on these two characters:</p> <p> Table 56: Pattern of Diacritics and Inversion of Cr Character to Indicate Format</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.4.6 Context:\u00a0 The default  EXS Context (see Section 3.6) is unmarked.\u00a0 The three other  contexts are shown via a superposed diacritic over the Cr character (or  underposed below the character if it is inverted).\u00a0 If the Cr character already has a diacritic  showing Function or Function+Format, it is modified as per the table below:</p> <p> Table 57: Modification of Function(+Format) Diacritics on Cr Character to Indicate Context </p> <p>EXS</p> <p>FNC</p> <p>RPS</p> <p>AMG</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.4.7 Illocution:\u00a0 This  category (see Section 5.3) is shown via a diacritic mark alongside the Cr character at the  mid-line following the character in the direction the particular line of  writing is written (unless the diacritic can be written \u201cinside\u201d a character whose shape has an obvious interior space, e.g., the l and x consonantal characters).</p> <p> Table 58: Illocution Diacritics on Cr Character</p> <p>ASR</p> <p>IRG</p> <p>DIR</p> <p>ADM</p> <p>\u00a0HOR</p> <p>DEC</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.4.8 Negative Polarity:\u00a0  The Ithkuil script allows for a \u201cshortcut\u201d representation of the NA1<sub>1</sub>/5 negation suffix, the most common method of negating a verb in Ithkuil. This shortcut is accomplished via a diacritic mark alongside the Cr character at the mid-line following the character in the direction of writing. The character is shown below in the first box of Table 59. Since this diacritic position is the same utilized for showing Illocution (see Table 58 above), the Illocution diacritics are modified to indicate this negation, as follows:</p> <p> </p> <p>Table 59: Illocution Diacritics on Cr Character Modified to Show Negative Polarity</p> <p>ASR</p> <p>IRG</p> <p>DIR</p> <p>ADM</p> <p>\u00a0HOR</p> <p>DEC</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.4.9 Suffixes:\u00a0  Derivational (Slot XI) Suffixes (see Chapter 7) are shown by additional Type 4  consonantal characters, placed following the Cr consonantal character.\u00a0 Each such character represents one VxC  suffix, its formation of prefixed and suffixed consonants identical to the  character formation principles previously described for the Cr consonantal  character, utilizing the same extensions and modifications shown in Tables 51  and 52 above.</p> <p>Suffix-Type: The default consonantal character is used to represent Type-1 suffixes. Types 2 and 3 are shown in the following ways: Type-2 suffixes are shown by vertically inverting the consonantal character. Type-3 suffixes are shown by  an underposed dot diacritic beneath the consonantal character.</p> <p>Suffix Degree: The nine suffix degrees are shown via superposed diacritics above the consonantal character (even if the character is  vertically inverted to represent a Type-2 suffix). The diacritics are shown in the following table.</p> <p>   Table 60:  Diacritics Representing Suffix Degree</p> Degree 1 Degree 2 Degree 3 Degree 4 Degree 5 Degree 6 Degree 7 Degree 8 <p>Degree 9</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>(none)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>11.3.4.10 Bias: The category of Bias (see Section 5.11) is shown by modification of the top-bar of a consonantal suffix character. If the formative does not carry a VxC suffix, then the modification is made to a special placeholder character consisting of a top-bar alone with no stem.</p> <p>The modifications are mostly the same modifications made to Cr characters for showing Pattern, Stem, and Relation, as shown  previously in Tables 54a and 54b, supplemented by additional underposed diacritics placed beneath the bottom-line of the character (shown next to the character in the following table). Note that for the last 16 biases whose representation utilizes a vertical-bar diacritic, if the placeholder top-bar character is used to represent these biases, then the character is laterally reversed rather than utilizing the vertical-bar diacritic.</p> <p> Table 61: Modifications to Consonantal Suffix Characters to Show Bias</p> ASU HPB COI ACP RAC STU CTV <p>DPV</p> Intensive Forms ASU+ HPB+ COI+ ACP+ RAC+ STU+ CTV+ <p>DPV+</p> RVL GRT SOL SEL IRO EXA LTL <p>CRR</p> Intensive Forms RVL+ GRA+ SOL+ SEL+ IRO+ EXA+ LTL+ <p>CRR+</p> EUP SKP CYN CTP DSM IDG SGS <p>PPV</p> Intensive Forms EUP+ SKP+ CYN+ CTP+ DSM+ IDG+ SGS+ <p>PPV+</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 11.4 WORD BOUNDARIES, PUNCTUATION, AND ALPHABETIC TRANSLITERATION <p>Because all written words begin with characters other than Type 4 (consonantal characters), while all words end with Type 4 characters, it is always possible to determine where new   words begin in a line of Ithkuil writing, obviating the need for a blank space   or other boundary between words. In turn, a blank space functions to indicate a   sentence boundary. And because Ithkuil morphology already indicates within words   themselves various attitudes, moods, and other information which are normally   indicated supra-segmentally in Western languages (e.g., by tone or inflection of   the voice, hyper-enunciation, etc.), symbols corresponding to exclamation points and   question marks are likewise unnecessary. The Ithkuil equivalents to subordinate and relative clauses are likewise indicated morphologically, as are coordinative/serial lists of words, therefore there is no need for any equivalent to the comma.</p> <p>The only \u201cpunctuation\u201d symbols used are   to show quotations of direct speech and phonetic transliteration (as when   spelling non-Ithkuil words and names). These two sets of symbols are shown   below. Note that the quotation marks are used only to indicate direct speech;   they are not used as in English to offset a word for emphasis or special usage.   The phonetic rendering marks indicate the word or phrase between the marks is to   be pronounced phonetically (i.e., alphabetically). </p> <p> insert quote here </p> <p> insert transliteration here </p> <p> </p> <p>11.4.1 Alphabetic Transliteration</p> <p>Proper names and other non-Ithkuil words, when transliterated into Ithkuil, are written alphabetically between the phonetic transliteration marks shown above. Consonants are written using the Type 4 consonant characters, utilizing the extensions from Tables 51 and 52 above (but not the diacritics from Table 53) to represent various consonant clusters or gemination. Transliteration is based on either a phonemic or phonetic representation of the non-Ithkuil word, without concern for any spelling conventions contained in the original/native script of the foreign word or name. Vowels are represented in the following ways:</p> <p>Vowels: For vowels preceding or following a consonant (or consonant conjunct) the top-bar modifications normally used for representing Pattern, Stem, and Relation are used \u2013 the vowel thereby being represented as part of the consonant character. If there is no consonant in the syllable to carry the vowel, a placeholder symbol consisting of a top-bar alone is used. These top-bar modifications are shown in the following tables (note that the vowel-sounds are indicated using the International Phonetic Alphabet):</p> <p> Table 62: Modifications to Consonant Characters to Transliterate Accompanying Vowel</p> modification: IPA value:  (none) a \u00e6 \u0251 o \u03b5 e I modification: IPA value:  i \u0259 u y /Y \u0153 \u00f8 / <p> By default, the vowel is to be pronounced following the consonantal form. If instead the vowel is to be pronounced preceding the consonant, the character carries a superposed dot diacritic. If there are two vowels in a row and there is no consonant character to carry the vowel, a placeholder consonant character is used consisting of a lone top-bar. Syllabic stress is shown by a superposed horizontal bar diacritic; if a dot diacritic is already present above the character, it changes to a vertical bar diacritic for stressed syllables. Diphthongs and long vowels are indicated by diacritics placed alongside the character in the direction of writing (unless the diacritic can be written \u201cinside\u201d a character whose shape has an obvious interior space, e.g., the l and x consonantal characters). Diphthongs ending in an -i/-y semivowel are indicated with a dot, those ending in -u/-w by a small vertical bar, and long vowels  by a  small horizontal bar.</p> <p>Tone: If necessary to transliterate a word carrying tone, the following underposed diacritics may be used under the consonant+vowel character corresponding to the syllable containing the toneme.</p> <p>   Table 63:   Diacritics to Consonant Characters for Transliteration of Syllabic Tone</p> <p>low</p> <p></p> <p>high</p> <p></p> <p>mid</p> <p></p> <p>rising</p> <p></p> <p>falling</p> <p></p> <p>fall-rise</p> <p></p> <p>rise-fall</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Note on Placenames and  Ethnonymns: In general, the Ithkuil names of real-world placenames and ethnonymns are the same as the native form to the extent that Ithkuil phonology allows and to the extent that such native terms can be distinguished. Otherwise, alternate names in common usage can be utilized. So, for example, the most technically correct Ithkuil name for China would be \u00eepal <sup>\u2013</sup>\u010cu\u0148\u02c7kwo, based on Ithkuil\u2019s  closest available  phonological equivalent to the Mandarin Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (IPA []), although the name \u00eepal \u010cin, based on the historically derived root (from both Persian and Sanskrit) would be acceptable as well. </p> <p>For placenames with multiple native names from equally official languages (e.g., the four  names of Switzerland in each of its four official languages), the Ithkuil phonological equivalent to any official name is acceptable. For names whose native ethnonymn is not common knowledge or not readily discoverable (e.g., the Andi people of Dagestan whose native ethnonymn is variously given as Qwannal, Qwannab, Khivannal), a name in common use can be used even if it is derived from a non-native source (e.g., the Russian-derived name \u201cAndi\u201d).</p> <p>The author intends at some future point to add a section to the Lexicon on the official Ithkuil names of major non-Ithkuil placenames and ethnonymns.</p> <p>Language Names: The Ithkuil name of a non-Ithkuil language is given by the native ethnonymn of the people or their nation/placename with the addition of the SSD<sub>1</sub>/5 suffix -(a)k added to the carrier root preceding the alphabetic name.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 11.5 HANDWRITTEN FORMS OF THE CHARACTERS <p>The various charts below display the handwritten equivalents to the various character types, the extensions to top bars and bottom bars, diacritics, etc. </p> <p>Primary Characters</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Secondary Aspect Characters</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Tertiary Characters</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Consonantal Characters</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Consonantal Extensions (Shown on -t-, -k-, and -g- characters)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 11.6 THE ALTERNATIVE ORNAMENTAL SCRIPT <p>The now defunct previous revision of Ithkuil known as Ilaksh utilized an experimental two-dimensional, non-linear writing system of colorful \u201ccartouche\u201d-like containers and hexagonal glyphs used to fashion an abstract morphological \u201cmap\u201d of an Ilaksh sentence. Now that the Ilaksh language has been withdrawn, it is the author\u2019s intention to eventually adapt this writing system to Ithkuil, for use as an alternative, \u201cornamental\u201d writing system for artistic purposes. When this adaptation is ready it will be placed in this section of the grammar. The graphic below illustrates a draft sample of what this writing system will look like.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"12/","title":"12 Numbers","text":"A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 12: The Number System <p> The Ithkuil system of numbers and counting is distinct from   Western languages in two fundamental ways: it is centesimal (base one hundred)   as opposed to decimal (base ten), and the numbers themselves are full formatives   (i.e., nouns and verbs), not adjectives. This has already been discussed briefly   in Section 4.5.1 regarding the PARTITIVE case. This section will examine the numerical system in   greater detail.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>12.1 FEATURES OF A CENTESIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM</p> <p>Being a centesimal system of enumeration, the numbers from zero   to 100 are considered autonomous units represented by single stems and written   using single autonomous symbols. Beginning with the number 101, numbers are   referred to by the number of hundreds plus the number of units, just as a   decimal system, beginning with the number 11, refers to the number of tens plus   the number of units. However, where a decimal system then shifts to a unit   referring to 100 once \u201c10 tens\u201d is reached, a centesimal system proceeds to the   number 10,000 before establishing a new unit reference (i.e., \u201c100 hundreds\u201d).   Thus the number 3254, which in a decimal system is 3 thousands \u2014 2 hundreds \u2014 5   tens \u2014 4 ones, in a centesimal system becomes 32 hundreds\u201454 ones, and would be   only two digits when written (the single character representing 32, and the   single character representing 54). The details of writing Ithkuil numerals are   given below in Section 12.5.</p> <p>After 100, separate unit numbers and symbols are assigned to   the square of 100 (i.e. ten thousand, that being \u201c100 hundreds\u201d), then the   square of that number, 100<sup>4</sup> (100 million, i.e., 10,000 ten-thousands). The final unit is 100<sup>8</sup>, that is,   10 quadrillion or 100 million hundred-millions, the last number for which   Ithkuil assigns a separate root and symbol. After ten quadrillion, numbers are   referred to as multiples of lower sets, similar to saying in English \u201cone   trillion quadrillion\u201d instead of the equivalent \u201cone octillion.\u201d</p> <p>While the above may seem unwieldy or even arbitrary, it   actually parallels Western base-ten numerals in terms of its systematization.   For example, in a Western number like 456,321,777,123, each set of three numbers   between the commas tells how many hundreds there are of a certain power of 1000   (i.e., there are 123 of 1000<sup>0</sup>, 777 of 1000<sup>1</sup>, 321 of 1000<sup>2</sup>,   and 456 of 1000<sup>3</sup>, or in more common terms 123 ones, 777   thousands, 321 millions, 456 billions).</p> <p>The same exact system holds for Ithkuil, except that the sets   of numbers \u201cbetween the commas\u201d so to speak, is the number of ten-thousands, not   thousands. Thus, if we were to rewrite the Western number 456,321,777,123 in   such a system, it would be 4563,2177,7123 (i.e., 7123 of 10000<sup>0</sup>,  2177 of 10000<sup>1</sup>, and 4563   of 10000<sup>2</sup>, that being 7123 ones, 2177 ten-thousands, and 4563   hundred-millions). </p> <p> </p> <p>12.2 SEMANTIC DESIGNATIONS FOR NUMERICAL STEMS</p> <p>The semantic roots for numbers in Ithkuil from 1 to 99 are   based on roots for 1 through 10, to which the nine degrees of the Slot XI derivational affix -Vk are added. Each of the nine degrees   of this suffix, when applied to one of the ten number-roots, corresponds to an   additional multiple of ten. This is illustrated in Table 64 below. </p> <p>Table 64: The SSD Affix   with Numerals</p> Degree Suffix Meaning Degree Suffix Meaning Degree Suffix Meaning 1 -ik stem + 10 4 -\u00eek / -u\u00ebk stem + 40 7 -ok stem + 70 2 -\u00f6k stem + 20 5 -ak stem + 50 8 -\u00fck / -aek stem + 80 3 -ek stem + 30 6 -\u00fbk / -i\u00ebk stem + 60 9 -uk stem + 90 <p> </p> <p>The addition of a particular degree of this affix to one of the   ten indicates that the root number is added to that multiple of ten. For   example, the stem ksal \u2018two,\u2019 plus the   seventh degree affix -Vk/7, gives ksalok \u2018seventy-two.\u2019 Because there is no root corresponding to \u2018zero\u2019 (see Sec. 12.3 below), each multiple of ten is constructed using   stem m\u0159al \u2018ten\u2019   plus one of the above suffixes. Thus, the numbers 20, 30 and 40 are respectively m\u0159alik, m\u0159al\u00f6k and m\u0159alek, but the   numbers 22, 32 and 42 are ksal\u00f6k, ksalek, and ksal\u00eek. This pattern only   operates up to the nineties, as there is a separate autonomous root for 100, -\u0148-.</p> <p>Since numbers are formatives in Ithkuil, not adjectives as in   most Western languages, holistic stem No. 1 is a formative   signifying a set containing a number of members corresponding to that particular   root. Thus, the formative ksal, translatable as   \u2018two,\u2019 actually means \u2018a set of two; a duo / to be a duo.\u2019 In turn, the two   complementary derivatives of each stem denote its multiple and its fraction   respectively.

As this root has no multiples, its semantic   designations follow a unique pattern. NOTE: The INFORMAL versus FORMAL distinction in this   root (i.e., Form I versus Form II of each stem) distinguishes between a focus on   non-duplication/singularity for the INFORMAL, and   indivisibility/unity for the FORMAL:</p> <p>1. llal / all\u00e1l \u2018a single entity; to be one in number\u2019 </p> <p>COMPLEMENTARY DERIVATIVES: ollal / oll\u00e1l: \u2018to be   indivisible, whole, a single unit; unitary; to unify\u2019 \u00e2llal / \u00e2ll\u00e1l: \u2018to be   (an) individual, a distinct entity in itself; to   individualize\u2019</p> <p>2. ellal / ell\u00e1l \u2018a lone entity, something alone; an entity in solitude, something/someone   isolated; be alone; to isolate; be in solitude\u2019</p> <p>COMPLEMENTARY DERIVATIVES: \u00f6llal / \u00f6ll\u00e1l: \u2018something/someone lonely; be or make lonely\u2019 \u00eallal / \u00eall\u00e1l: \u2018something/someone independent, self-sufficient, singular (i.e., without   need of, connection to, or dependency on others); be or make independent,   self-sufficient, singular\u2019</p> <p>3. ullal / ull\u00e1l \u2018something/someone unique, the only one; to be or make unique\u2019</p> <p>COMPLEMENTARY DERIVATIVES: \u00fbllal / \u00fbll\u00e1l: \u2018a sole entity,   the only one available or able (in terms of sufficiency or applicability to the   context)\u2019 \u00f4llal / \u00f4ll\u00e1l: \u2018something/someone one-of-a-kind, unparalleled, without equal or peer (in   terms of uniqueness of characteristics)\u2019</p> <p>   The Ithkuil numerical roots as described in the section above are as   follows:</p> -ll- -ks- -\u0163k- -px- -s\u0163- -cq- -ns- -fy- -xm- -m\u0159- one two three four five six seven eight nine ten -\u0148- -zm- -pstw- -\u010dk<sup>h</sup>- one hundred ten thousand one hundred million ten quadrillion <p> </p> <p></p> <p>12.3 EXPRESSING \u201cZERO\u201d</p> <p>Ithkuil has no word for \u201czero\u201d nor is it conceptualized as a   numerical category. Instead any appropriate formative may take the PTW suffix in first-degree   -iss \u2018no amount of\u2019 or the EXN suffix in first-degree -ib \u2018no\u2026at all\u2019 in   terms of degree or extent to create negative expressions that convey the idea of   an absence of a numerical entity or quantity. In many cases, simply the negative   of whatever formative is under discussion may be used. </p> <p>As for handling the concept of zero as a null placeholder when   writing Ithkuil numbers, this is addressed in Section 12.4 below.</p> <p> </p> <p>12.4 WRITING NUMERALS</p> <p>Writing Ithkuil numerals is somewhat similar to writing numbers   in Western languages (i.e., \u201cArabic\u201d numerals), in that the interpretation of a   number as a different power of 100 (analogous to interpreting single Arabic   numerals as either ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.) is based on its   sequence within the entire number. However, there are two aspects of writing   Ithkuil numbers that are quite different from Arabic numbers.:</p> <ol> <li> Ithkuil does not employ a symbol for zero. Instead, Ithkuil   employs separate autonomous symbols for each power of 100 (100, 10,000, 100   million, etc.) each of which operates as the appropriate placeholder instead of   zero. To illustrate what this means by analogy, pretend that \u201c@\u201d is an   autonomous symbol for 27 (since Ithkuil numbers from 1 to 99 each have a   separate symbol), \u201c&amp;\u201d is a symbol for 100, \u201c#\u201d is a symbol for 10,000 and   there is no symbol 0 (zero). The numbers 2700, 2705, 327, 22700 and 4,270,027   would then be written @&amp;, @5, 3@, 2@&amp;, and 4@#@ respectively. (NOTE: In   actual practice, numbers which contain the \u201chundred\u201d symbol, here represented as   \u201c&amp;,\u201d normally place a dot above or below the adjacent numeral and dispense   with the &amp;, indicating that the number so marked is to be multiplied by 100.    <li> Since Ithkuil is a base-100 system, numbers do not become two   digits in length until the hundreds, do not become three digits in length until   the ten thousands, do not become four digits in length until the millions,   etc. </li> <p> </p> <p>One must also remember that in terms of left-to-right  orientation, numbers follow the boustrophedon mode the same   as the Ithkuil script (see Sec.   11.3.2). Similarly to Western languages, small non-compound numbers can be   written using either their numerical symbols or written out in script (as in   English \u201c12\u201d versus \u201ctwelve\u201d).</p> <p>The following table gives the Ithkuil numerical symbols along   with their morphological stems. The symbols for 11 through 99 consist of the symbols for 1 through 9 plus various extensions added to their lower left \u201ctrailing\u201d line indicating the particular 10-group to be added.

The number of   largest base units is shown by placing the base-unit term in the PARTITIVE. If this is then followed by another collection of   smaller base units, that number of smaller base units is connected using the   COMITATIVE case while the smaller base-unit term is again in   the PARTITIVE. Single units (from 1 to 99) are connected by   the coordinative affix when they are part of the number of hundreds or higher   base-units. </p> <p>It should be noted that when pronouncing numbers greater than   199, it is normal in Ithkuil to omit the word \u0148ial (=   the PARTITIVE of \u0148al \u2018one hundred\u2019) referring   to the number of hundreds. This is equivalent to the custom in colloquial   English of saying \u2018three twelve\u2019 for \u2018three hundred (and) twelve.\u2019 The   difference is that in Ithkuil, this omission of the word for \u2018hundred\u2019 is the   preferred option, the word \u0148ial being used only in larger numbers   for clarity\u2019s sake.</p> <p>These principles are illustrated by the following examples:</p> <p>     ksal\u00eek \u00a0(\u0148ial) \u00a0xmal\u00f6k     literally: \u201c42   (of hundreds) 29\u201d 4229 </p> <p> </p> <p>     cqal\u00f6k \u00a0zmial \u00a0nseuluk \u00a0(\u0148ial) \u00a0cqal\u00fbk     literally: \u201c26 of   ten-thousands with 97 (of hundreds) 66\u201d = 26,9766 269,766</p> <p> </p> <p>     llal\u00f6k\u00a0 \u0148ial\u00a0 zmual     literally: \u201c21 of   hundred of ten-thousands\u201d 21,000,000      [NOTE: \u0148ial is required in this example]</p> <p>      ksalok\u00a0 \u0148ial\u00a0 xmaloki\u0148\u00a0  apstwial\u00a0 \u0163keul\u00a0 \u0148ial\u00a0 \u0163kalaki\u0148\u00a0 zmual\u00a0  pxeulek\u00a0 m\u0159al\u00fbk     literally:    \u201c72 of hundreds and 79 of hundred-millions with 3 of hundreds and 53 of   ten-thousands with 34  60\u201d  727,903,533,460</p> <p>   We have already seen that when numbers are used to indicate   how many of a certain noun there are, the noun must appear in the PARTITIVE case, since the number itself is functioning as the   \u201chead\u201d of the numerical expression (e.g., English \u201c12 boxes\u201d being constructed   in Ithkuil as a \u201c12-set of a box\u201d or perhaps more appropriately a \u201cbox-dozen\u201d).   Another syntactical consequences of numbers being full formatives is when a   number functions as a label or overt identifier, as in the English sentence You\u2019ll find him in Room 216. Such usage of numbers is not primarily   sequential (which would involve the equivalent of \u201cordinal\u201d numbers such as   \u2018fourth,\u2019 \u2018twenty-sixth\u2019, etc. equivalent to stem No. 3 of each number root) but   rather organizational (e.g., as in the three-dimensional array of room numbers   in a hotel). Ithkuil handles such organizational labeling using either the COMPARATIVE case (see Sec.   4.5.32) or the ESSIVE case (see Sec. 4.5.9) depending respectively on   whether the enumeration of the noun in question is to distinguish it from other   enumerated nouns versus merely identifying the noun by a numerical name.   Examples:</p> <p> a\u00e7t\u00e1l \u00a0ksou\u2019lik \u2018room\u2019-OBL \u00a0  \u00a0\u2018twelve\u2019-CMP \u2018the   room marked \u201c12\u201d\u2019 OR \u2018Room 12\u2019 OR \u2018Room No. 12\u2019 [i.e., as opposed to being some other  room]</p> <p> </p> <p> a\u00e7t\u00e1l \u00a0ksealik \u2018room\u2019-OBL \u00a0  \u00a0\u2018twelve\u2019-ESS \u2018the   room marked \u201c12\u201d\u2019 OR \u2018Room 12\u2019 OR \u2018Room No. 12\u2019 [identifying   reference only]</p> <p>   Lastly, when numbers comprising multiple number-stems are   declined for case, configuration, extension, etc., rather than writing out the   entire number \u201clong-hand,\u201d the number symbol is used, preceded by the carrier   stem ep- (see Sec. 9.3) which carries the appropriate   declensions. This use of the carrier stem applies even to single-stemmed numbers   when writing, in order to allow use of the number symbol instead of writing it   out. In such cases involving single-stemmed numbers, the carrier stem is not   pronounced (rather, the numerical stem bears the pronounced declensions); it is   there only as a written indicator of the morphological declensions/derivations to be applied to the number   stem.  </p>"},{"location":"2/","title":"2 Morphophonology","text":"A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 2: Morpho-Phonology <p>   Morpho-phonology refers to how a language uses its phonemes      (meaningful sounds) and phonological features (e.g., stress, tone, etc.) to      generate patterns for word-formation and for morphological categories (e.g.,  singular versus plural, verb tense, etc.) to be applied to words.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 2.1        GRAMMATICAL TYPOLOGY <p>Ithkuil morpho-phonology is primarily agglutinative  and secondarily    synthetic. That is, the manner in which morpho-semantic stems, inflections    and derivations are formed, and how those elements combine meaningfully into    words, is primarily  via the joining of one or more affixes (including prefixes, suffixes, infixes and interfixes) to a semantic root, where the affixes themselves  are highly synthetic (i.e., combining numerous morphological categories together into a single phonological form). </p> <p> 2.1.1 The Structure of Ithkuil Words</p> <p>As will be discussed later in Section 2.4, the part of speech in Ithkuil which corresponds to nouns and verbs in Western languages is called a formative. The morphological structure of the Ithkuil formative can be shown by the following formula: </p> <p>   (((Cv +) VL +) Cg/Cs +) Vr + (Cx/Cv + Vp/VL +) Cr + Vc (+ Ci +Vi)  + Ca (+ VxC ) (+ Vf (+ Cb)) [+ tone] [+ stress] </p> <p> The above terms, other than Cr, [tone] and [stress], refer to various consonantal or vocalic affixes. Cr corresponds to the word-root itself which is dicussed below in Section 2.2. All of the terms shown in gray are optional. However, as indicated by the pattern of parentheses in the formula, the presence of certain terms requires the presence of others. </p> <p>The above morphological formula can be looked at as a series of numbered \u201cslots\u201d which will perhaps facilitate explanation of each term:</p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +     Sanction     (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR     Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +     Function Incorp.Root       OR     Phase + Sanction     (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

Detailed explanation of these terms are found in succeeding sections or subsequent chapters.</p> <p> Table 3: Explanation of Terms within the Morphological Formula for Ithkuil Formatives</p> I Cv An  word-initial consonantal prefix which indicates the categories of Phase (see Section 5.5) and Sanction (see Section 5.6). Both Phase and Sanction are mandatory categories, however the presence of Cv in a formative is optional (i.e., unmarked) if both the Phase and Sanction of the formative have their default values. If Cv is present in Slot I, then Slot II through IV (see below) must be filled and Slot III must be filled by Cs, not Cg. II VL A vocalic affix which shows a verbal category called Valence, discussed in Section 5.7.  Valence is a mandatory category, however the presence of VL is optional (i.e., unmarked) if the formative\u2019s valence has its default value and Slot I (Cv) is unfilled/unmarked. If VL is present, then Slots III and IV below must also be filled. III Cg/Cs <p>A consonantal affix which indicates either of two categories: (1) Validation (see Section Section 5.9), in which case this term is referred to as Cg, or (2) Aspect, in which case this term is referred to as Cs. The actual phonological forms of Cg and Cs are distinct from one another so  there is no confusion when interpreting which category is being conveyed. The presence of Cv in Slot I (see above) requires that Slot III be filled by Cs, not Cg. </p> <p>Aspect (Cs) is an optional category. It is possible for a formative to not carry any particular aspect, in which case the value of Cs (if present) will simply be a placeholder consonantal form.</p> <p>Validation (shown by Cg) is a mandatory category, however the presence of Cg is optional if the formative's valence has its default category. If the formative's validation is not its default value, but the presence of Cg is not allowed due to Slot III already being filled by Cs, then the word must be restructured to remove Cv from Slot I and to remove Cs from Slot III in order to allow the presence of Cg. The formative's Phase and Sanction (Cv) and Aspect (Cs) will instead be shown either by use of an adjunct (see Section 2.4.2 below), or by moving Cv and Cs to Slots V and XI respectively (if possible - see explanation for Slots V and XI below). </p> <p>The presence of either Cg or Cs in Slot III requires that Slot IV be filled.</p> IV Vr A vocalic \u201cportmanteau\u201d affix (i.e., conveying multiple types of morphological information), indicating the following morphological categories: Pattern and Stem (see Section 2.2.2 below), and Function (discussed in Section 5.1). Pattern and Stem are mandatory for all formatives, whereas Format occurs only if the formative carries an incorporated stem (see Cx in Slot V below).  V Cx/Cv <p>Slot V serves two possible functions: (1) Cx, a consonantal form indicating an incorporated root (discussed in Section 6.4) or, in the absence of an incorporated root,  it becomes (2) the slot for Cv showing the formative\u2019s Phase and Sanction (thus moving it from Slot I above). The presence of Cx or Cv in Slot V requires that Slot VI also be filled. </p> <p>If functioning as Cx,  the formative must carry Format information shown by the term Vf in Slot XII below. If there is no Format shown in Slot XII, then any term in Slot V must be Cv, not Cx.</p> <p>If there is no incorporated root and the formative's Phase and Sanction have their default values or are already shown in Slot I, then Slot V is left empty (as well as Slot VI).</p> VI Vp/VL Slot VI serves two possible functions: (1) Vp, a vocalic affix indicating the Stem and Pattern (see Section 2.2.2 below) as well as Designation      (see Section 3.7) of the incorporated root Cx in Slot V above, or, in the absence of an incorporated root,  it becomes (2) the slot for VL showing the formative\u2019s Valence (thus moving it from Slot II above). If there is no incorporated root then Slot VI is left empty along with Slot V. VII Cr A mandatory consonantal form (from one to five consonants in length) which represents the semantic root of the formative (see Section 2.2 below).  Cr cannot be  -w-, -y-, -h-, -hw-, -hr-, -hh-, -hn-, -hm-, -lw-, -ly-, -rw-, -ry-, -\u0159w-, or -\u0159y-.  VIII Vc  This is a mandatory vocalic affix indicating the case of the formative. The category of Case is discussed in Chapter 4.  IX Ci +Vi This is a consonant + vowel term consisting of one of four consonantal forms (w-, y-,  h-, or hw-) plus a vocalic form, the whole of which indicates the Mood and Illocution   of the formative (see Sections 5.2 and 5.3 respectively). Mood and Illocution are mandatory categories but both have default forms.  If Mood and Illocution are in their default forms, then Slot IX is usually left unfilled/unmarked. X Ca A mandatory consonantal portmanteau affix indicating the following five categories: Configuration, Affiliation, Perspective,  Extension and Essence. These categories are all discussed in Chapter 3.  XI Vx+C An optional derivational suffix of the form vowel+consonant(s) which conveys additional morpho-semantic information. There are approximately 200 such suffixes which can be combined with a formative to expand the meaning of a word. These suffixes can also be multiply added to a stem, i.e., two or more such affixes can appear on a stem. These suffixes are  analyzed at length in Chapter 7.  XII Vf A  vocalic suffix which conveys the categories of Context (discussed in Section 3.6) and Format (discussed in Section 6.4). The presence of Format information requires that an incorporated root be present in the formative (i.e., the Cx term in Slot V above). In the absence of an incorporated root, Vf conveys the category of Context only. While Context is mandatory, it has a default value which, in the absence of Format and a Bias suffix in Slot XIII, is unmarked (i.e., Slot XII is left empty). XIII \u2019Cb A consonantal word-final suffix of the form glottal stop + consonant which indicates one of 48 Bias categories (discussed in Section 5.11). Bias is an optional category and is left unmarked (i.e., unfilled) if not present. However, if present, then Slot XII must also be filled. XIV [tone] The six morphologically relevant tones (see Section 1.3.2) of an Ithkuil formative  indicate  the category of Version (see Section 5.8), a mandatory category. XV [stress] As previously described in Section 1.3.3, there are four possible stress patterns for an Ithkuil formative, which convey the categories of Designation (see Section 3.7) and Relation (see Section 5.4).  <p>Based on the above morphological formula, we can see that  the simplest structure for a formative is </p> <p>Vr + Cr + Vc  + Ca + tone+stress</p> <p>as illustrated by the examples p<sup>h</sup>al, \u00a0eqoec, \u00a0and \u00a0\u203e\u00fcaklar\u0161l\u00e1 below: </p> <p> </p> <p> p<sup>h</sup>al \u2018tree\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p> Vr = (a-),*\u00a0 indicating Pattern 1,  Stem 1 of the root plus STATIVE  function     Cr = -p<sup>h</sup>-, indicating the root: \u2018branched/leaved plant\u2019     Vc = -a-,\u00a0 indicating OBLIQUE case     Ca = -l, indicating NORMAL  essence, DELIMITIVE extension, MONADIC perspective, UNIPLEX configuration, and CONSOLIDATIVE    affiliation     tone  = falling, indicating PROCESSUAL  version     stress  = penultimate**, indicating INFORMAL  designation and UNFRAMED relation</p> <p>*Note that the full form is ap<sup>h</sup>al, however when the value of Vr is word-initial a- for a formative with penultimate stress, this initial a- can be deleted.</p> <p>**As explained in Section 1.3.3,  monosyllabic words are considered to have penultimate stress for  morpho-phonological purposes.</p> <p> </p> <p> eqoec \u2018regarding humankind\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p>Vr = e-,\u00a0  indicating Pattern 1, Stem 2 of the root plus STATIVE function     Cr = -q-, indicating the root: \u2018higher order life-form\u2019     Vc = -oe-,\u00a0  indicating REFERENTIAL case     Ca = -c, indicating NORMAL essence, DELIMITIVE  extension, ABSTRACT perspective, UNIPLEX configuration, and CONSOLIDATIVE affiliation     tone =  falling, indicating PROCESSUAL  version     stress  = penultimate, indicating INFORMAL  designation and UNFRAMED relation</p> <p> </p> <p>   \u203e\u00fcaklar\u0161l\u00e1 \u2018it is/being a representation of the man-made  courses/channels of a river that has dried up\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p>Vr = \u00fca-,\u00a0  indicating Pattern 3, Stem 1 of the root plus MANIFESTIVE function     Cr = -kl-, indicating the root:\u00a0 \u2018water  in natural motion\u2019     Vc = -a-,\u00a0  indicating OBLIQUE case     Ca = -r\u0161l(a), indicating REPRESENTATIVE essence, DEPLETIVE extension, MONADIC perspective, AGGREGATIVE configuration, and ASSOCIATIVE affiliation     tone =  high, indicating COMPLETIVE  version     stress  = ultimate, indicating FORMAL  designation and UNFRAMED relation</p> <p> </p> <p>From the simpler formative structures above, we can examine the  structure of increasingly complex words, e.g.,</p> <p>Vr + Cr + Vc  + Ci +Vi + Ca  + Vx+Cs + Vf + \u2019Cb + tone + stress, as in:</p> <p> Uip<sup>h</sup>aw\u00e2t\u013c\u00fbxe\u2019\u0148?

Or, in other words, how can one tell which slots are filled? In fact, such interpretation is indeed possible and is unambiguous due to the specific allowable consonant or vowel combinations allowed for each term, i.e., the specific consonantal or vocalic values allowed for one term are distinct from those allowed for another term which might occupy the same sequential position in a specific word. Also, as previously stated in Section 2.1.1 above and as indicated by the pattern of parentheses in the (((Cv +) VL +) Cg/Cs +) Vr + (Cx/Cv + Vp/VL +) Cr + Vc (+ Ci +Vi)  + Ca (+ VxC ) (+ Vf (+ Cb)) [+ tone] [+ stress] morphological formula, the presence of certain terms e.g., VL, requires the presence of other terms (Ci + Vc), in order to maintain a discernible sequence which can be unambiguously differentiated. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 2.2 ROOT AND STEM FORMATION <p>All words in Ithkuil which translate into English as nouns    or verbs are based on a monosyllabic  stem, which    in turn derives from a semantically abstract root. This process    is explained in the sections below.</p>    2.2.1 The Root  <p>The root in Ithkuil forms the semantic basis    from which actual noun/verb stems are derived. The root consists of a consonantal form, Cr, comprised of one to four consonants (e.g., -k-, -st-, -ntr-, -pstw-).Given Ithkuil phonotactic constraints (see Section 1.4) this gives approximately 3600 possible roots. (Note: roots of five consonants, e.g., -rpskw- are also phonotactically possible and available, but currently remain unassigned.)   Cr cannot be a single glottal stop, nor w, y, h, hw, hr, hh, hn, hm, lw, ly, rw, ry, \u0159w, or \u0159y. The root occupies Slot VII  of a formative\u2019s morpho-phonological structure, as shown below.</p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction       (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR       Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

Suffix Context + Format Bias Version Designa-       tion + Relation <p> </p> <p>The root is the basic semantic unit in Ithkuil. For example,  d- is a root whose semantic referent is \u2018NAME/DESIGNATION\u2019.    Functional word-stems (or simply stems) are generated from the    root via instantiation of the Vr- vocalic affix, as described below.</p>    2.2.2 Stem and Pattern <p>There are three stems associated with each root. It is at the    level of stem that Ithkuil roots become actual words with instantiated meaning.    Each stem in turn manifests itself in three separate Patterns. Both Pattern and Stem are shown by changes to the Vr- vocalic affix.  </p> <p>The three patterns are labeled Pattern 1, Pattern 2, and    Pattern 3. Pattern is used to divide a stem into a tripartite grouping consisting    of a holistic stem and two complementary sub-stems.    An example would be the holistic stem spouse, with its two complementary    sub-stems husband and wife. This holistic versus complementary distinction is discussed at length below in Section 2.3. This distinction of holistic versus    complementary patterns is one way in which Ithkuil systematizes at the morphological    level what in other languages constitute lexical distinctions (i.e., differences    in word-choice when translating). It is one of the many ways by which Ithkuil    can function fully as a conceptually sophisticated and subtle language while  having such a small number of semantic word roots.</p> <p>A formative\u2019s Pattern and Stem are shown by the Vr affix in Slot IV, as previously described in Section 2.1.1. Besides showing a formative\u2019s Pattern and Stem, Vr shows the morphological category of Function, discussed in Section 5.1. </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +     Sanction (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR       Aspect     (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +     Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

We will start with the three stems  associated with Pattern 1; these are the holistic stems. This    will be followed in a subsequent section by an analysis of the twelve stems    associated with Patterns 2 and 3, the complementary stems.</p>    2.3.1 Holistic Stems <p>The three stems for Pattern 1 are designated by the Vr affixes (a-), e-, and u- respectively. Thus,    the  root -d- \u2018NAME/DESIGNATION\u2019 generates the following stems:</p> <p> 1. (a)d-\u2018name of  something or someone; to name something or someone\u2019 2. ed- \u2018designation  or reference; to assign a designation, to refer to something\u2019 3. ud- \u2018a  (temporary or informal) reference, \u201cnickname\u201d; to give a (temporary or  informal) reference or name to, to (temporarily) nickname\u2019</p> <p>The semantic relationship between each stem and the underlying root is  specific to each root. Nevertheless, certain patterns are common. Stem 1  usually refers to the most fundamental, basic, generalized, or common  manifestation of the root concept, while Stem 2 is a more specific application  or tangible manifestation thereof, or otherwise a subset of the meaning of Stem  1. Stem 3 may represent yet a further manifestation of the root, a further  subset of Stem 1, or a tangential or related concept. For example, compare the  relationship between the individual stems for the root -d- above with that of the  root -x- (\u2018VISION/SIGHT\u2019) below.</p> <p>1. (a)x- \u2018a  sighting, an act of seeing something; to see something\u2019     2. ex- \u2018an eye; to  be an eye/become an eye/use one\u2019s eye, etc.\u2019     3. ux- \u2018an image in  one\u2019s mind; to visualize, to picture in one\u2019s mind\u2019</p> <p>Note that each stem carries both a nominal (noun) and a verbal    meaning. This will be important later when we discuss parts of speech and nominal/verbal    morphology. </p>    2.3.2 Complementary Stems <p>Any Ithkuil stem is capable of being further broken down into    two complementary stems which represent mutually exclusive    component parts or aspects of the main stem. Many Ithkuil stems which translate common    English nouns and verbs are, in fact, such complementary derivatives, rather    than being holistic word-stems. </p> <p>By \u201ccomplementary\u201d is meant that the manifestation    of a concept appears in any given context as either one sort of entity or another,    but never both simultaneously; yet, neither manifestation can be considered    to be a discrete contextual whole without the existence of the other. In Ithkuil,    for example, words such as male, night, speech, sit,    and happen are not considered basic concepts, but rather are parts    of greater holistic concepts, existing in complementary relationship to another    part, the two together making up the whole. </p> <p>Thus, Ithkuil lexical structure recognizes that the word male has no meaning in and of itself without an implicit recognition of its complementary    partner, female, the two words mutually deriving from a more basic,    holistic concept, translatable into English as living being. Similarly,    the word night(time) derives along with its complement day(time) from the underlying concept translatable as day (i.e., a 24-hour period),    while the concept of speak(ing) divides into complementary concepts    of talking (focusing on the physical production of oral sound) versus saying/telling (focusing on the communicative content of oral sound). </p> <p>Actions, too, are not exempt from this principle of complementarity,    an example being the relationship between sit and seat; one    has no meaning without an implicit and joint partnership with the other, i.e.,    one cannot sit unless one sits upon something, and whatever one sits upon in    turn functions as a seat. Another example involves the word happen or occur, which Ithkuil recognizes as having no real meaning without    the attendant implication of consequence or result, the two    being complementary components of a holistic concept roughly translatable as event or situation.</p> <p>    2.3.2.1 Using Patterns 2 and 3 to Derive Complementary    Stems. The first complementary stem is derived from the holistic stem    by shifting the values of Vr to Pattern 2, i.e., o-, \u00f6-, and \u00ee- (or \u00fb-), while the second complementary stem is derived by shifting Vr to Pattern 3, i.e., \u00e2-, \u00ea-, and \u00f4-. Several examples of complementary stem derivation    are given below:</p> Holistic            Stem <p>eq-: human being, person</p> 1st            Comp. Stem <p>\u00f6q-: male person </p> 2nd            Comp. Stem  <p>\u00eaq-: female person</p> Holistic            Stem <p>akl\u00e1-: a river </p> 1st            Comp. Stem <p>okl\u00e1-: the water in a river </p> 2nd            Comp. Stem <p>\u00e2kl\u00e1-: a riverbed, river channel</p> Holistic            Stem <p>ult-: an act of written composition; to compose    something in writing</p> 1st            Comp. Stem <p>\u00fblt-: the physical act of composing in writing; to    physically write a composition</p> 2nd            Comp. Stem  <p>\u00f4lt-: the written content or message of a composition;    to create written content</p> Holistic            Stem <p>ax-: sight; to undergo an act of seeing (both sensory    experience and thing seen)</p> 1st            Comp. Stem <p>ox-: an act of seeing, a usage of one\u2019s faculty of    sight; to see with one\u2019s eyes, to undergo a sighting</p> 2nd            Comp. Stem <p>\u00e2x-: a view, a sight, something (to be) seen; to cast a    sight or image</p> <p> 2.3.2.2 Complementary Stems in Translation. As illustrated    above, the structure of Ithkuil holistic vs. secondary complementary roots often    neatly parallels English lexical distinctions, e.g., \u2018speak/speech\u2019    breaking down into the physical aspect of \u2018talking\u2019 versus the communicative    aspect of \u2018saying/telling\u2019 or \u2018person\u2019 breaking down    into \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female.\u2019 However, it is often the case    that this principle of complementarity creates a semantic situation which is  counterintuitive to Western semantic notions. </p> <p>For example, let us analyze the root -mm- \u2018NUCLEAR FAMILY MEMBER\u2019. While most languages    would consider the concept parent as fundamentally opposite from the    concept child and assign separate word-roots to each, Ithkuil recognizes    that one implies the other. No person can be a parent unless they've had a child,    just as any child must have (or have had) parents. This, then, constitutes an    archetypal complementary relationship, the whole two-sided nature of which is    referred to by the holistic stem -mm-.    One way to interpret the meaning, then, of -mm- is to say that the word means both \u2018parent\u2019 and \u2018child,\u2019    which of course strikes one as being problematical, perhaps even nonsensical.    But in fact, the word does not mean either \u2018parent\u2019 or \u2018child,\u2019    but rather a person who is one of the members of a parent-child relationship,    i.e., a member of a nuclear family. With such a root, Stem 2 and Stem 3 in turn    subdivide Stem 1 into the further complementary derivatives of male and female.    Such \u201cbi-level\u201d derivations of complementary concepts using Stem    2 and Stem 3 are common in Ithkuil root/stem derivation. Here then are the actual    meanings of the stems for -mm-.</p> Holistic        Stem 1st        Complementary Stem 2nd        Complementary Stem Stem 1 <p>amm- nuclear family member </p> <p>omm-: parent</p> <p>\u00e2mm-: child (offspring)</p> Stem 2 <p>emm-: male nuclear family member </p> <p>\u00f6mm-: father </p> <p>\u00eamm-: son</p> Stem 3 <p>umm-: female nuclear family member </p> <p>\u00fbmm-: mother </p> <p>\u00f4mm-: daughter</p> <p>    Additional conceptual complementary pairs which would be contained within    single Ithkuil lexical roots are illustrated by the following examples:</p> Holistic      Concept Complementary      Concepts  eating food ingestion think, act of thinking a thought (thing considered) process of consideration liquid fluid (= ontological nature) wet[ness] (=defining attribute)  measuring  a measurement process of measuring transference of possession giving taking traversal between points coming, arrival   going, departure commercial transaction  buying selling <p> </p> <p></p> 2.4      PARTS OF SPEECH <p>Ithkuil has only two parts of speech: formatives and adjuncts. While there are words which function as nouns and    verbs, such nouns and verbs derive morphologically from the same grammatical    stem (its nominal or verbal function or meaning being dependent on the particular    morpho-semantic context), hence the term formative. This process of    noun/verb derivation from formatives is discussed in detail in Section 2.4.1    below. Note that there are no adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, pronouns, determiners,    conjunctions, particles or interjections in Ithkuil, at least not at any autonomous    lexical level that can be termed a part of speech. The equivalents to, or substitutes    for, these latter Western grammatical notions all exist within the formative-adjunct    morphological paradigm.</p> <p>Another dissimilarity with Western languages is that there    are no irregular or defective forms; all formatives and adjuncts follow the    same inflectional and derivational rules without exception and all formatives    are theoretically capable of semantic denotation for every inflectional or derivational    category, i.e., all inflectionally or derivationally possible words theoretically    exist and have meaning (although, in actuality, some forms will of course    be semantically anomalous, redundant, contrived, or distinguish shades of meaning    that are contextually unnecessary).</p>      2.4.1 Formatives  <p>The stem formed as per the discussion in Section    2.3 above constitutes the grammatical part of speech termed the formative.    All formatives, without exception, can function as both nouns or verbs, and    the distinction as to whether a formative is to be interpreted as a noun or    a verb can only be made by analyzing its morpho-syntactic    relationship to the rest of the sentence. Consequently, there are no stems/formatives    that refer only to nouns or only to verbs as in Western languages. The formative akl\u00e1- illustrated above in Section 2.3.2 means both    \u2018river\u2019 and \u2018to flow/run (as a river)\u2019 with neither    meaning being seen as more intrinsic or fundamental, nor one deriving from the    other. Such hierarchies of nominal over verbal meaning (or vice-versa) arise    only in translating Ithkuil to English or other Western languages, where such    nominal versus verbal lexical constraints are inherent. Often, the interpretation    or translation of an Ithkuil formative exclusively into a noun or verb form  is arbitrary. </p> <p> The reason why nouns and verbs can function as morphological derivatives of    a single part of speech is because Ithkuil morpho-semantics does not see nouns    and verbs as being cognitively distinct from one another, but rather as complementary    manifestations of an idea existing in a common underlying semantic continuum    whose components are space and time. As in physics, the holistic continuum containing    these two components can be thought of as spacetime. It is in this continuum    of spacetime that Ithkuil instantiates semantic ideas into lexical roots, giving    rise to the part of speech termed the formative. The speaker then chooses to    either spatially \u201creify\u201d this formative into an object    or entity (i.e., a noun) or to temporally \u201cactivize\u201d it    into an act, event, or state (i.e., a verb). This complementary process can    be diagrammed as follows:</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 2.4.2 Adjuncts  <p>Besides formatives, the other part of speech is the adjunct. Adjuncts are so named because they operate in conjunction with    adjacent formatives to provide additional grammatical information about the    formative, somewhat like auxiliary verbs in English (e.g., \u201cmay, will,    would, do, have\u201d) or like noun determiners (e.g., \u201cthe, this, those\u201d). </p> <p>Adjuncts are formed from one or more consonantal and/or vocalic    affixes, combined agglutinatively. There are several different types of adjuncts, described in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter  8. These include:</p> <ul> <li>Personal Reference Adjuncts: The nearest      equivalent to Western personal pronouns, identifying in abbreviated form      the participant entities to a verb or the entities associated with a particular      noun in some case relationship. (See Section 8.1.) </li> <li>Verbal Adjuncts:      These are used in conjunction with verbal formatives to provide information      on the morphological categories of Valence, Level, Phase, Sanction, Illocution, Modality, Aspect and Bias. Each of these categories is discussed in Chapter        5 or Chapter 6. </li> </ul> <p> </p> 2.5      NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY <p>While this chapter has mentioned a few specific morphological    categories in passing, beginning with Chapter      3: Basic Morphology, morphological (i.e., grammatical) categories will be    discussed in detail. It should be noted that, given the extensive array of overt    morphological categories in Ithkuil, the terminology used in naming these categories    is often arbitrary. Where a category functions similarly to a familiar linguistic    category, the name of that category has been appropriated. Elsewhere, linguistic    terminology from Indo-European, Uralic, Amerindian or Caucasian grammar    has been appropriated out of convenience, often with only a small similarity  of function. In still other instances, I have contrived my own grammatical nomenclature.</p>"},{"location":"3/","title":"3 Basic Morphology","text":"<p> As previously discussed in  Section 2.4.1, the distinction between nouns and verbs common to most languages    is rather blurred in Ithkuil. All lexical stems in Ithkuil function equally    as nouns or verbs and share many of the same morpho-semantic features and categories.    This is because Ithkuil morpho-semantics does not see nouns and verbs as being    cognitively distinct from one another, but rather as complementary manifestations    of ideas existing in a common underlying semantic continuum whose components    are space and time. The equivalents to nouns and verbs in other languages are    merely \u201creified\u201d (or nominalized) and \u201cactivized\u201d (or    verbalized) derivatives of semantic formatives. Nevertheless, for simplicity\u2019s    sake, we will refer to nominal formatives as nouns and verbal formatives as  verbs when discussing their morphology.</p> <p>All Ithkuil formatives, whether functioning as nouns or verbs,    inflect for nine Configurations, four Affiliations,    four Perspectives, six Extensions, two Essences, four Contexts, and two Designations, and can take any of approximately 1800 optional    suffixes. These morphological categories are explained in the sections which    follow. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3.1 CONFIGURATION <p>To understand the Ithkuil concept of enumeration and quantification    of nouns (i.e., what other languages term singular, plural, etc.) one must analyze    three separate but related grammatical categories termed Configuration, Affiliation, and Perspective. These concepts    are alien to other languages. While they deal with semantic distinctions which    are quantitative in nature, these distinctions are usually made at the lexical    level (i.e., via word choice) in other languages, not at the morphological as    in Ithkuil. In this section we will deal first with Configuration, followed    by Affiliation in Section 3.2 and Perspective in Section      3.3.</p> <p>Specifically, Configuration deals with the physical similarity    or relationship between members of a noun referent within groups, collections,    sets, assortments, arrangements, or contextual gestalts, as delineated by internal    composition, separability, compartmentalization, physical similarity or componential    structure. This is best explained and illustrated by means of analogies to certain    English sets of words.</p> <p>Consider the English word \u2018tree.\u2019 In English, a    single tree may stand alone out of context, or it may be part of a group of    trees. Such a group of trees may simply be two or more trees considered as a    plural category based on mere number alone, e.g., two, three, or twenty trees.    However, it is the nature of trees to exist in more contextually relevant groupings    than merely numerical ones. For example, the trees may be of like species as    in a \u2018grove\u2019 of trees. The grouping may be an assortment of different    kinds of trees as in a \u2018forest\u2019 or occur in patternless disarray    such as a \u2018jungle.\u2019</p> <p>As another example, we can examine the English word \u2018person.\u2019    While persons may occur in simple numerical groupings such as \u2018a (single)    person\u2019 or \u2018three persons\u2019 it is more common to find persons    (i.e., people) referred to by words which indicate various groupings such as    \u2018group,\u2019 \u2018gathering,\u2019 \u2018crowd,\u2019 etc. </p> <p>Segmentation and amalgamated componential structure are further    configurative principles which distinguish related words in English. The relationships    between car versus convoy, hanger versus rack, chess piece versus chess set, sentry versus blockade, piece of paper versus sheaf, girder versus (structural)      framework, and coin versus roll of coins all exemplify    these principles.</p> <p>Another type of contextual grouping of nouns occurs in binary    sets, particularly in regard to body parts. These binary sets can comprise two    identical referents as in a pair of eyes, however they are more often    opposed or \u201cmirror-image\u201d (i.e., complementary) sets as in limbs, ears, hands, wings, etc.</p> <p>In Ithkuil, the semantic distinctions implied by the above    examples as they relate to varying assortments of trees or persons would be    accomplished by inflecting the word-stem for \u2018tree\u2019 or \u2018person\u2019    into one of nine configurations. Additional semantic distinctions on the basis    of purpose or function between individual members of a set could then be made    by means of Affiliation (see Section 3.2 below) and by    the use of specific suffixes. For example, once the words for \u2018forest\u2019    or \u2018crowd\u2019 were derived from \u2018tree\u2019 and \u2018person\u2019    via Configuration, the Ithkuil words for \u2018orchard,\u2019 \u2018copse,\u2019    \u2018team\u2019 or \u2018mob\u2019 could easily be derived via affiliation    and affixes. (Such derivations into new words using suffixes are explored in    detail in Chapter      7: Suffixes.)</p> <p>Ithkuil words indicate Configuration via a synthetic consonantal affix immediately following the C+V stem which also indicates the Affiliation, Perspective,  Extension and Essence of the stem. This is the Ca affix discussed in Section 2.1.1. </p> <p> </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +     Sanction (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR       Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

The function and morphology of these categories are explained below along with examples of the various configurations applied to four different stems: ap<sup>h</sup>-, eq-, el-,  and up\u0161\u00e1-.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.1 UNI The Uniplex <p>The UNIPLEX configuration  indicates    a single, contextual embodiment of the stem concept, i.e., one whole contextual    unit of the basic nominal stem, e.g., a tree, a person, a screwdriver, a      grape, a hammer blow, a hole. With verbs the UNIPLEX signifies a single, holistic act, state, or event, e.g., to be a tree, to        become a person, to use a screwdriver, to eat a grape, to strike (once) with        a hammer, to dig a hole. Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p> p<sup>h</sup>al \u2018a tree\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>        eqal\u2018a person\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> elal \u2018an  utterance; a spoken word\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p> up\u0161\u00e1l \u2018an incident\u2019</p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.2 DPX The Duplex <p>The DUPLEX configuration  indicates    a related binary set. While it often refers to body parts, e.g., one\u2019s    eyes, ears, lungs, wings, etc., it can also be used to describe any set of two    identical or complementary objects or entities, e.g., a matched pair of      vases, a two-volume set, a set of bookends, mutual opponents. Thus, the    Ithkuil word for spouse inflected for the DUPLEX configuration would translate as a man and wife or a married couple.</p> <p>One context in which the DUPLEX appears    for both nouns and verbs is with events which contain two complementary \u201chalves\u201d    exemplified by English words such as bounce, flash, arc, wag, swing, switch, breathe/respiration,    indeed, any concept which involves a dual-state notion of up/down, to/fro, back/forth,    in/out, empty/full, or on/off. Use of the DUPLEX in these    contexts implies a full cycling through the two complementary states involved.    For example the word for hammer blow inflected for the UNIPLEX would signify the singular impact of the hammer, whereas the same word inflected    for the DUPLEX signifies a single down-then-up cycle of    the swing of the hammer, the two complementary \u201chalves\u201d of the action    being divided by the impact. Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p> p<sup>h</sup>all \u2018a pair of trees\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>       eqall \u2018a couple\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> elall \u2018a pair of words\u2019</p> up\u0161\u00e1ll \u2018a pair of incidents\u2019 <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.3 DCT The Discrete  <p>The DISCRETE configuration  indicates    a grouping or set of the basic stem units that are more or less identiform (each    having the same design or physical appearance). This grouping or set-nature    can be either spatial, as in a flock of gulls (flying together), or    temporal (i.e., sequentially repetitive or iterative) as in (a flock of)      gulls flying one after another. Further examples of English nouns or noun    phrases which would be translated using the DISCRETE are a grove, a set of screwdrivers, a group of soldiers, a pile of leaves, a      bowl of grapes, a series of hammer blows, an area of holes. Thus, the Ithkuil    word for (identical) set would simply be the word for thing or object inflected for the DISCRETE configuration.    Note that the distinction between a spatially configured set versus a temporally    (i.e., iterative) configured set would be made by use of either the DPR suffix,    -\u0161k,    or the SEP suffix, -mb specifying which spacetime axis is implied. These suffixes are analyzed in Sec.      7.4.13.</p> <p>For verbs, the DISCRETE signifies a single    set of repetitions, whether spatially or temporally, viewed as a single holistic    event. The individual member components acts, states, or events within this    set can be either UNIPLEX, e.g., to take steps, to      flip through pages, to have spots, to dig holes in an area, or DUPLEX in nature, e.g., to hammer, to spin, to breathe.</p> <p>It should be noted that the Containment CNM suffix, -mt,    can be used with the DISCRETE,  as well as most of the    following configurations, to designate specifically the type of container, holder,    or means of conveyance for a configurative set (e.g., a sack, package, jar,  bottle, pile, load, etc.) Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>        p<sup>h</sup>at\u013c \u2018a grove\u2019  eqat\u013c \u2018a group of matching people\u2019 <p></p> <p> </p> <p>         elat\u013c \u2018a set of identical words\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>       up\u0161\u00e1t\u013c \u2018a set of similar incidents\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table 5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.4 AGG The Aggregative <p>The AGGREGATIVE configuration  functions    like the DISCRETE above in referring to an associated    group or set of entities, except that the members of the configurational set    are not identical to one another. Examples of English words/entities which would    be translated using the AGGREGATIVE are a forest (of different kinds of trees), a toolset, a citizens group, a mixed pile      of leaves, an assortment of animals, an area of different-sized holes, a series      of musical notes. With verbs, the AGGREGATIVE implies    a spatially or temporally repeated set of non-identical acts, events, or states    considered as a whole contextual unit. It would be used, for example, in translating    the sentence This morning I dug holes in my garden (i.e., of different    sizes). Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>        p<sup>h</sup>a\u013c \u2018a forest; a wood\u2019  eqa\u013c \u2018a group of different people\u2019 <p></p> <p> </p> <p>       ela\u013c \u2018a set of (differing) words; a phrase\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>       up\u0161\u00e1\u013c \u2018a set of differing incidents\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.5 SEG The Segmentative <p>The SEGMENTATIVE configuration  indicates    a grouping or set of the basic stem units, the individual members of which are    physically similar or identical and are either in physical contact with one    another, physically connected via some linking medium, or in sufficiently close    contact with one another so that the group moves or operates together. Examples    would be a web, a train of flatcars, a convoy of schoolbuses, a string of      pearls, a fall of leaves, a line of dancers, a parade of Barbie dolls (e.g.,    coming off an assembly line). To illustrate the difference between this configuration    and the DISCRETE above, we saw that the word grape in the DISCRETE would be translated as a serving of      grapes, while in the SEGMENTATIVE it would mean a        bunch of grapes (i.e., still connected to each other on a portion of vine). </p> <p>With verbs, the use of the SEGMENTATIVE versus the DISCRETE implies that the repetitive/iterative    nature of the act, state, or event occurs naturally due to the contextual nature    of the precipitating event or agent. It would thus be used to distinguish the    fuselage of bullets from a machine-gun from the simple hail of bullets from    single-fire weapons. Likewise, it would distinguish The light is blinking from The light is flashing, where blink implies the way    in which the source naturally emits light, while flash implies that  the light is being made to emit repetitive bursts of light. Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>        p<sup>h</sup>a\u013c\u013c \u2018a stand (or line) of trees\u2019  eqa\u013c\u013c \u2018a line/wall of matching people\u2019  (e.g., shoulder-to-shoulder or with arms linked) <p></p> <p> </p> <p>         ela\u013c\u013c \u2018a string of words\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>       up\u0161\u00e1\u013c\u013c \u2018a chain of similar incidents\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.6 CPN The Componential <p>The COMPONENTIAL configuration operates    identically to the SEGMENTATIVE above, except that the    individual members of the configurational set are not physically similar or    identical to each other. Examples of English words/entities which would be translated    using the COMPONENTIAL are a freight train, a cascade      of (mixed) fruit (i.e., a continuous stream of fruit falling), a line of ticketholders,      a parade of floats, a pattern of musical notes. With verbs, the COMPONENTIAL signifies a connected series of repetitions where the individual acts, events,    or states comprising the repetitive set are non-identical. It would distinguish The light twinkled from The light was blinking. Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>        p<sup>h</sup>a\u0159\u013c \u2018a line/stand of different trees\u2019  eqa\u0159\u013c \u2018a line/wall of different people\u2019  (e.g., shoulder-to-shoulder or with arms linked)  <p></p> <p> </p> <p>       ela\u0159\u013c \u2018a string of differing words\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>       up\u0161\u00e1\u0159\u013c \u2018a chain of differing incidents\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below. </p> 3.1.7 COH The Coherent <p>The COHERENT configuration  functions    similarly to the SEGMENTATIVE above, except that the individual    members of the configuration are connected, fused or mixed with one another    to form a coherent emergent entity, i.e., the total configuration of objects    constitutes an entirely new gestalt-like entity. Examples of English words which    would be translated using the COHERENT are a bookcase,      a phalanx, a xylophone. </p> <p>In the realm of verbs, finding English translations illustrating    the COHERENT is difficult. If one can imagine the verb to glow to mean a series of flashes blurred one into another to create    a continuous emanation, then glow versus flash might suffice.    Perhaps a better illustration would be the difference between to buzz from to make a set of repeating noises. Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>          p<sup>h</sup>ask \u2018an entangled grove of trees\u2019        (i.e., their roots/branches intertwined        and grown together)   eqask \u2018a mass/unit of similar people\u2019 <p></p> <p> </p> <p>       elask \u2018a speech made up of similar words\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>       up\u0161\u00e1sk \u2018a web of similar incidents\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.8 CST The Composite <p> The COMPOSITE configuration  operates    the same as the COHERENT above except that the individual    members of the configurational set are not identical or physically similar to    one another. Examples of words/concepts that would be translated using the COMPOSITE are a building (= a constructional set of walls, floors, doors, windows,    etc.), a communications array, a conspiracy, a jungle thicket. Thus    the Ithkuil words for recipe, skeleton, and melody would simply    be the words for ingredient, bone, and musical note inflected for the COMPOSITE configuration. For verbs,    the COMPOSITE versus COHERENT distinction    would distinguish to rumble from to buzz, or to glitter from to glow.  Examples:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>        p<sup>h</sup>a\u0161k \u2018a jungle\u2019  eqa\u0161k \u2018a mass/unit of different people\u2019 <p></p> <p> </p> <p>       ela\u0161k \u2018a speech\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>       up\u0161\u00e1\u0161k \u2018a  situation (involving a number of incidents)\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this configuration, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.1.9 MLT The Multiform <p>The MULTIFORM configuration  is    the most difficult to explain, as there is no Western linguistic equivalent.    The MULTIFORM serves to identify the noun as an individual    member of a \u201cfuzzy\u201d set. A fuzzy set is a term which originates    in non-traditional logic, describing a set whose individual members do not all    share the same set-defining attributes to the same degree, i.e., while there    may be one or more archetypical members of the set which display the defining    attributes of the set exclusively and exactly, other members of the set may    vary from this archetypical norm by a wide range of degrees, whether in physical    resemblance, degree of cohesion or both. Indeed, some members of the set may    display very little resemblance to the archetype and be closer to the archetype    of a different fuzzy set, i.e., fuzzy sets allow for the idea of \u201cgradient    overlap\u201d between members of differing sets.</p> <p>It is difficult to accurately translate into English without    resorting to paraphrase the sorts of concepts that Ithkuil easily expresses    using the MULTIFORM. For example, the Ithkuil word for    \u2018tree\u2019 inflected for the MULTIFORM configuration    would mean something like a group of what appear to be trees, or better    yet, a group of tree-like objects (i.e., some being trees, and others    seeming less like trees). Essentially, any set of entities whose similarity    of membership varies by different degrees in comparison to an archetypical member    of the set can be expressed using the MULTIFORM. For examples,    the Ithkuil word for library would simply be a word meaning something    like work (i.e. thing authored/composed) inflected for the MULTIFORM,    signifying a hodge-podge assortment of writings and compositions (e.g., including    books, pamphlets, notebooks, ledgers, formulas, letters, journals, recordings,    magazines, etc.). Other example concepts translatable using the MULTIFORM would be a rag-tag group of people, an incoherent pattern, lives in flux.</p> <p>With verbs, the MULTIFORM implies that    the individual repetitions comprising an act, state, or event have varying degrees    of spatio-temporal similarity to each other. A few English verbs such as fluctuate,      sputter or flicker capture this sense.

Affiliation operates synergistically    in conjunction with Configuration to describe the total contextual relationship    between the members of a set. Like Configuration, the meanings of nouns or verbs    in the various affiliations often involve lexical changes when translated into    English.</p> <p>Returning to our earlier example of the word tree,    we saw how a group of trees of the same species becomes a grove in    the DISCRETE configuration. The word grove implies    that the trees have grown naturally, with no specific purpose or function in    regard to human design or utilization. On the other hand, groves of trees may    be planted by design, in which case they become an orchard. We saw    how trees occurring as a natural assortment of different kinds is termed a      forest. However, such assortments can become wholly chaotic, displaying    patternless disarray from the standpoint of subjective human design, thus becoming a jungle.</p> <p>As another example, we saw how the word person becomes group, or gathering, both of which are neutral as to subjective    purpose or function. However, applying a sense of purposeful design generates    words such as team, while the absence of purpose results in crowd.</p> <p>There are four affiliations: CONSOLIDATIVE, ASSOCIATIVE, VARIATIVE, and COALESCENT.

The details of the four affiliations are explained below.</p> 3.2.1  CSL The Consolidative <p>The CONSOLIDATIVE affiliation indicates    that the individual members of a configurational set are a naturally occurring    set where the function, state, purpose or benefit of individual members is inapplicable,    irrelevant, or if applicable, is shared. It differs from the ASSOCIATIVE affiliation below in that the role of individual set members is not subjectively    defined by human design. Examples are tree branches, a grove, a mound of      rocks, some people, the clouds. </p> <p>The CONSOLIDATIVE is also the affiliation    normally applied to nouns in the UNIPLEX configuration    when spoken of in a neutral way, since a noun in the UNIPLEX specifies one single entity without reference to a set, therefore the concept    of \u201cshared\u201d function would be inapplicable. Examples: a man,      a door, a sensation of heat, a leaf. With verbs, the CONSOLIDATIVE would imply that the act, state, or event is occurring naturally, or is neutral    as to purpose or design.</p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this affiliation, see Table    5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> 3.2.2 ASO The Associative <p>The ASSOCIATIVE affiliation indicates    that the individual members of a configurational set share the same subjective    function, state, purpose or benefit. Its use can be illustrated by taking the    Ithkuil word for soldier in the DISCRETE configuration    and comparing its English translations when inflected for the CONSOLIDATIVE affiliation (= a group of soldiers) versus the ASSOCIATIVE (= a troop, a platoon). It is this CONSOLIDATIVE versus ASSOCIATIVE distinction, then, that would distinguish    otherwise equivalent DISCRETE inflections of the Ithkuil    word for tree by translating them respectively as a grove versus an      orchard. </p> <p>The ASSOCIATIVE affiliation can also    be used with nouns in the UNIPLEX configuration to signify    a sense of unity amongst one\u2019s characteristics, purposes, thoughts, etc.    For example, the word person inflected for the UNIPLEX and ASSOCIATIVE would translate as a single-minded      person. Even nouns such as rock, tree or work of        art could be inflected this way, subjectively translatable as a well-formed          rock, a tree with integrity, a \u201cbalanced\u201d work of art.</p> <p>With verbs, the ASSOCIATIVE signifies    that the act, state or event is by design or with specific purpose. The CONSOLIDATIVE versus ASSOCIATIVE distinction could be used, for example,    with the verb turn in I turned toward the window to indicate    whether it was for no particular reason or due to a desire to look outside.</p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this affiliation, see Table    5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> 3.2.3 VAR The Variative <p>The VARIATIVE affiliation indicates that    the individual members of a configurational set differ as to subjective function,    state, purpose or benefit. The differences among members can be to varying degrees    (i.e., constituting a fuzzy set in regard to function, purpose, etc.) or at    complete odds with one another, although it should be noted that the VARIATIVE would not be used to signify opposed but complementary differences among set    members (see the COALESCENT affiliation below). It would    thus be used to signify a jumble of tools, odds-and-ends, a random gathering,      a rag-tag group, a dysfunctional couple, a cacophony of notes, of a mess of      books, a collection in disarray. It operates with nouns in the UNIPLEX to render meanings such as a man at odds with himself, an ill-formed rock,        a chaotic piece of art, a \u201clefthand-righthand\u201d situation.</p> <p>With verbs, the VARIATIVE indicates an    act, state, or event that occurs for more than one reason or purpose, and that    those reasons or purposes are more or less unrelated. This sense can probably    be captured in English only through paraphrase, as in She bought the house      for various reasons or My being at the party served several purposes.    With non-UNIPLEX configurations, the use of the VARIATIVE affiliation can describe rather complex phenomena; for example, a sentence using    the SEGMENTATIVE configuration such as The light is      blinking in conjunction with the VARIATIVE would    mean that each blink of the light signals something different than the preceding    or following blinks.</p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this affiliation, see Table   5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> 3.2.4 COA The Coalescent <p>The COALESCENT affiliation indicates    that the members of a configurational set share in a complementary relationship    with respect to their individual functions, states, purposes, benefits, etc.    This means that, while each member\u2019s function is distinct from those of    other members, each serves in furtherance of some greater unified role. For    example, the Ithkuil word translating English toolset would be the    word for tool in the AGGREGATIVE configuration    (due to each tool\u2019s distinct physical appearance) and the COALESCENT affiliation to indicate that each tool has a distinct but complementary function    in furtherance of enabling construction or repair activities. Another example    would be the Ithkuil word for finger inflected for the SEGMENTATIVE configuration and the COALESCENT affiliation, translatable    as the fingers on one\u2019s hand (note the use of the SEGMENTATIVE to imply the physical connection between each finger via the hand). A further    example would be using the COALESCENT with the word for (piece of) food to signify a well-balanced meal.</p> <p>The COALESCENT naturally appears most    often in conjunction with the DUPLEX configuration since    binary sets tend to be complementary. It is used, for example, to signify symmetrical    binary sets such as body parts, generally indicating a lefthand/righthand mirror-image    distinction, e.g., one\u2019s ears, one\u2019s hands, a pair of wings.    Pairs that do not normally distinguish such a complementary distinction (e.g., one\u2019s eyes) can nevertheless be optionally placed in the COALESCENT affiliation to emphasize bilateral symmetry (e.g., one\u2019s left and      right eye functioning together).</p> <p>With verbs, the COALESCENT signifies    that related, synergistic nature of the component acts, states, and events which    make up a greater holistic act, state, or event. It imposes a situational structure    onto an act, state, or event, where individual circumstances work together in    complementary fashion to comprise the total situation. It would be used, for    example, to distinguish the sentences He traveled in the Yukon from He ventured in the Yukon, or I came up with a plan versus I fashioned a plan.</p> <p>For the set of affixes which mark this affiliation, see Table  5 in Section 3.5.3 below.</p> <p> </p> 3.3. PERSPECTIVE    Perspective is the closest Ithkuil morphological category to the Number and    Tense categories of other languages (e.g., singular/plural and past/present/future).    However, the correspondence is only approximate because Perspective does not    specifically address the quantity to which a formative is instantiated within    a given context, nor when it occurs relative to the present, but rather the    manner in which it is spatio-temporally instantiated. Specifically,    Perspective indicates whether a noun or verb is to be identified as 1) a \u201cbounded\u201d    contextual entity (i.e., having a spatio-temporally unified or accessible manifestation),    2) an unbounded entity (i.e., manifested as spatio-temporally separated or inaccessible),    3) as a unified collective or generic entity throughout spacetime, or 4) as    a spatio-temporally neutral abstraction. How this works requires separate explanations    for nouns and verbs.  <p>Perspective with Nouns. What Perspective means    for nouns is that, in addition to merely indicating whether a given spatial    context contains one or more than one, it also specifies single versus multiple    manifestations in time, as well as along an axis of concreteness versus abstraction.    Complicating the picture is the fact that the categories of Configuration and    Affiliation (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above) already    contain an implicit numerical element due to the fact that they usually describe    multi-membered sets. It is for all these reasons that the terms \u201csingular\u201d    and \u201cplural\u201d have been avoided. </p> <p>Perspective with Verbs. For verbs, the aspect    of \u201cboundedness\u201d inherent in Perspective does not imply a quantitative    context but rather an aspect of spatio-temporal \u201caccessibility,\u201d    i.e., whether or not an act, state, or event can be viewed as a unified whole    within the present temporal context. This is a long way from the \u201ctense\u201d    categories of Western languages. In Ithkuil, the notion of linearly progressive    time is not inherently expressed in the verb (although it can be specified,    if necessary, using various aspectual markers - see Section      5.10).</p> <p>There are four perspectives in Ithkuil: MONADIC, UNBOUNDED, NOMIC, and ABSTRACT.    These are indicated as part of the Ca affix as explained in Sec. 3.1 above. </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction     (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR       Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction     (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

Suffix Context + Format Bias Version Designa-       tion + Relation <p>The actual values of these Ca affixes are shown later in Table    5 in Section 3.5.3 below, following the explanation of the category of Essence. Each perspective\u2019s specific meaning and usage is explained     and illustrated below. </p> <p> </p> 3.3.1 M The Monadic <p>The MONADIC signifies a bounded embodiment    of a particular configuration. By \u201cbounded embodiment\u201d is meant    a contextual entity which, though possibly numerous in membership or multifaceted    in structure, or spread out through a time duration, is nevertheless being contextually    viewed and considered as a \u201cmonad,\u201d a single, unified whole perceived    to exist within a literal or figurative psychologically uninterrupted boundary.    This is important, since configurations other than the UNIPLEX technically imply more than one discrete entity/instance being present or taking    place. For nouns, this boundary is physically contiguous, like a container,    corresponding to the \u201csurface\u201d of an object (whether literal or    psychological). For verbs, this boundary is psychologically temporal, specifically    the \u201cpresent\u201d (which in Ithkuil might be better thought of as the    \u201ccontext at hand\u201d or the \u201cimmediately accessible context\u201d).    This distinction as to how \u201cbounded embodiment\u201d is interpreted for    nouns and verbs is appropriate, given that Ithkuil considers nouns as spatially      reified concepts while considering verbs to be their temporally \u201cactivized\u201d counterparts (see Section 2.4.1).</p> <p>Thus, using the word tree for example, while there    might be many trees present in terms of number, the MONADIC implies they form only one embodiment of whatever particular Configuration category    is manifested. Using the AGGREGATIVE configuration as    an example, the MONADIC would mean there is only one AGGREGATIVE set of trees, i.e., one forest. </p> <p>At this point, it should be noted in regard to Perspective    that Ithkuil makes no distinction between \u201ccount\u201d and \u201cnon-count\u201d    (or \u201cmass\u201d) nouns. In languages such as English, nouns differ between    those that can be counted and pluralized (e.g., one apple, four boys, several      nations), and those which cannot be counted or pluralized (e.g., water,        sand, plastic, air, laughter). All nouns are countable in Ithkuil in that    all nouns can exist as contextual monads. As a result, English translations    of certain Ithkuil nouns must often be \u201ccontextual\u201d rather than    literal, employing various conventions to put the noun in a numerical and pluralizable    context, e.g., \u2018some dirt,\u2019 \u2018the air here\u2019 or \u2018a    puff of air\u2019 rather than \u201ca dirt\u201d or \u201can air.\u201d</p> <p>With verbs, the MONADIC superficially    corresponds in a very approximate fashion with Western present tense categories    except in a habitual sense. As noted above, the bounded embodiment conveyed    by the MONADIC means that the act, state, or event is    temporally contiguous and accessible from the point of view of the present context.    It would be used to describes an act, state, or event which:</p> <ul> <li> takes        place entirely in the present context </li> <li> started        in the accessible past and has continued on into the present context </li> <li> starts        within the present context and continues on into an accessible future  </li> <li> started        in an inaccessible past, but only the portion taking place in the present        context is being addressed or is under consideration or relevant within        the context of the utterance </li> <li> starts        within the present context and may continue into an inaccessible future,        but only the portion taking place in the present context is being addressed        or is under consideration or relevant within the context of the utterance </li> <li> started        in an inaccessible past and will continue into an inaccessible future, but        only the portion taking place in the present context is being addressed        or is under consideration or relevant within the context of the utterance   </li> </ul> <p>By \u201caccessible past\u201d or \u201caccessible future\u201d    is meant a past or future where the speaker was (or will be) spatially present    at the time and the time elapsed between then and \u201cnow\u201d is psychologically    contiguous, i.e., the speaker views the passage of time from then till now as    one continuous temporal flow of moments, not as disconnected memories, disconnected    predictions, or historical reports. Conversely, \u201cinaccessible\u201d would    mean a past or future where the speaker was not or will not be present or which    he/she knows only from memory, reports, or predictions. Examples: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>        akl\u00e1l \u2018a river;         a river flows\u2019        u\u2019t\u2019ak\u2019a\u0159\u0161 \u2018constellation;     a constellation shines (in the night sky) \u2019        vyarl \u2018a set of benefits;     a set of benefits is in effect\u2019 <p> </p> 3.3.2 U The Unbounded <p>The UNBOUNDED signifies \u201cunbounded    embodiment\u201d of a particular configurative entity, meaning that the noun    or verb manifests itself as not being contained within an uninterrupted boundary,    i.e., in contextually \u201cdisconnected\u201d manifestations. For nouns,    the term \u201cplural\u201d has been avoided so as not to imply that the member    nouns are not being referred to quantitatively per se, but rather as a non-monadic    (i.e., non-unified) manifestation of a configurative set. While the most convenient    translation into English would be to use the plural, e.g., trees, groves, lumps    of dirt, a semantically (if not morphologically) more accurate rendering would    be \u2018a tree here, a tree there,\u2019 \u2018this grove and another and    another\u2026,\u2019 \u2018dirt-lump after dirt-lump after dirt-lump\u2026.\u2019 </p> <p>For verbs, \u201cunbounded embodiment\u201d means that the    psychological temporal boundary of an act, state, or event is not accessible    from the present context. This would apply to an act, state, or event which:</p> <ul> <li>  occurs        entirely in the inaccessible past  </li> <li> will        occur entirely in the inaccessible future (if used with the PROSPECTIVE aspect - see Section 5.10.2) </li> <li> may        be occurring in the present context but started in an inaccessible past,        and the portion occurring in the present context cannot be understood without        taking into account that past portion  </li> <li> may        be occurring in the present context but will continue into an inaccessible        future, and the portion occurring in the present context cannot be understood        without taking into account the future portion </li> <li> started        in an inaccessible past and will continue into an inaccessible future, and        the portion occurring in the present context cannot be understood without        taking into account these inaccessible portions </li> </ul> <p>Note that, even more so than with the MONADIC,    translation of the UNBOUNDED into Western languages is    subjective, as the translation must necessarily convey linear tense information    which is not conveyed by the Ithkuil original.</p> <p>Examples: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>        akl\u00e1t \u2018what once was a river;           the river once flowed (but no longer)\u2019 <p> </p> <p>         u\u2019t\u2019ak\u2019a\u0159g \u2018a past constellation;            the constellation shone (but no longer)\u2019 </p> <p> </p> <p>         vyark         \u2018a former set of benefits;        a set of benefits was in effect (but no longer)\u2019</p> 3.3.3 N The Nomic <p>The NOMIC refers to a generic collective    entity or archetype, containing all members or instantiations of a configurative    set throughout space and time (or within a specified spatio-temporal context).    Since it is all members being spoken of, and no individual members in particular,    this category is mutually exclusive from the MONADIC or UNBOUNDED. For nouns, the NOMIC corresponds approximately to the several constructions used for referring to    collective nouns in English, as seen in the sentences The dog is a noble beast, Clowns are what children love most, There      is nothing like a tree. </p> <p>With verbs, the NOMIC designates an action,    event, or situation which describes a general law of nature or a persistently    true condition or situation spoken of in general, without reference to a specific    instance or occurrence of the activity (it is, in fact, all possible instances    or occurrences that are being referred to). English has no specialized way of    expressing such generic statements, generally using the simple present tense.    Examples of usage would be The sun doesn't set on our planet, Mr. Okotele      is sickly, In winter it snows a lot, That girl sings well.</p> <p>Examples: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>          akl\u00e1\u0163 \u2018(flowing) river(s) (as a generic concept)\u2019 <p> </p> <p>           u\u2019t\u2019ak\u2019a\u0159\u00e7 \u2018(shining) constellation(s) (as a generic concept)\u2019 </p> <p> </p> <p>         vyarx \u2018a set of benefits being in effect (as a generic concept)\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3.3.4 A The Abstract <p>Similar to the formation of English abstract nouns using suffixes    such as -hood or -ness, the ABSTRACT transforms a configurative    category into an abstract concept considered in a non-spatial, timeless, numberless    context. While only certain nouns in English can be made into abstracts via    suffixes, all Ithkuil nouns in all Configurative categories can be made into    abstracts, the translations of which must often be periphrastic in nature, e.g., grove \u2192 the idea of being a grove or \u201cgrovehood\u201d; book  \u2192 everything      about books, having to do with books, involvement with books.</p> <p>With verbs, the ABSTRACT is used in verbal    constructions to create a temporal abstraction, where the temporal relationship    of the action, event, or state to the present is irrelevant or inapplicable,    similar to the way in which the English infinitive or gerund form (used as substitutes    for a verb phrase) do not convey a specific tense in the following sentences: Singing is not his strong suit; It makes no sense to      worry about it; I can't stand her pouting. As    a result, the ABSTRACT acts as a \u201ctimeless\u201d  verb form which, much like these English infinitives and gerunds, operates in    conjunction with a separate main verb in one of the other three perspectives.    The ABSTRACT is often used in conjunction with certain    modalities and moods of the verb (see Sec.      6.1 on Modality and Section        5.2 on Mood) which convey hypothetical or unrealized situations, in which    the temporal relationship to the present is arbitrary, inapplicable, or unknowable. </p> <p> Examples: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p>          akl\u00e1c \u2018the river as an idea / everything about being a river / \u201criver-hood\u201d \u2019 <p> </p> <p>           u\u2019t\u2019ak\u2019apst \u2018the idea of a constellation / \u201cconstellation-hood\u201d \u2019 </p> <p> </p> <p>       vyar\u010d \u2018the idea of having/providing benefits\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3.4 EXTENSION <p>Extension is another Ithkuil morphological category for which    there is no exact equivalent in other languages. It applies to all formatives    and indicates the manner in which the noun or verb is being considered in terms  of spatial or temporal extent or boundaries. There are six extensions: DELIMITIVE, PROXIMAL, INCEPTIVE, TERMINATIVE, DEPLETIVE, and GRADUATIVE.</p> <p>Extension is shown as part of a formative\u2019s Ca affix which also indicates Configuration, Affiliation,  Perspective and Essence.

It can be    considered the neutral or default view, e.g., a tree, a grove, a set of      books, an army. To illustrate a contextual example, the English sentence He climbed the ladder would be translated with the word ladder in the DELIMITIVE to show it is being considered as a    whole. With verbs, this extension indicates that the act, state, or event is    being considered in its entirety, from beginning to end, e.g., She diets      every winter (i.e., she starts and finishes each diet).</p> <p>The DELIMITIVE can be thought        of as an expanse of spacetime that has definite beginning and ending points,        beyond which the noun or verb does not exist or occur. The graphic to        the right illustrates the spatio-temporal relationship of a concept in        the DELIMITIVE to the context at-hand (i.e., the        spatio-temporal \u201cpresent\u201d).</p> <p>Examples: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p>           akl\u00e1l \u2018a river\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p>     p\u0161a\u0161k \u2018a situation\u2019</p> 3.4.2 PRX The Proximal <p>The PROXIMAL extension indicates that    a noun is being spoken of not in its entirety, but rather only in terms of the    portion, duration, subset, or aspect which is relevant to the context at hand.    It would be used to translate the words tree, journey, and ladder in the sentences That tree is hard there (e.g., in    the spot where I hit against it), She lost weight during her journey,    or He climbed on the ladder (i.e., it is not relevant to the context    to know if he made it all the way to the top). Note that in these sentences,    the PROXIMAL does not refer to a specific or delineated    piece, part, or component of the tree or ladder, but rather to the fact that    delineated boundaries such as the ends of the ladder or the entirety of the    tree are not relevant or applicable to the context at hand. With verbs, this    extension signifies that it is not the entirety of an act, state, or event which    is being considered, but rather the spatial extent or durational period of the    act, state, or event relevant to the context, e.g., She\u2019s on a diet      every winter (i.e., focus on \u201chaving to live on\u201d a diet, not    the total time spent dieting from start to finish). </p> <p></p> The graphic to the right illustrates      the spatio-temporal relationship of a noun or verbal concept in the PROXIMAL to the context at-hand (i.e., the spatio-temporal \u201cpresent\u201d).     <p>Examples: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p> <p>            akl\u00e1s            \u2018a section/stretch of (the) river\u2019</p> <p>    p\u0161ams    \u2018the midst of a situation\u2019</p> 3.4.3 ICP The Inceptive <p>The INCEPTIVE extension focuses on the    closest boundary, the beginning, initiation, or the immediately accessible portion    of a noun or verb, without focusing on the boundaries of the remainder. It would    be used in translating the nouns tunnel, song, desert, daybreak and plan in the following sentences: We looked      into (the mouth of) the tunnel, He recognizes that song (i.e., from the    first few notes), They came upon (an expanse of) desert, Let\u2019s wait      for daybreak, I\u2019m working out a plan (i.e., that I just thought of).    In verbal contexts it would correspond to the English \u2018to begin (to)\u2026\u2019    or \u2018to start (to)\u2026\u2019 as in He began reading, It\u2019s      starting to molt, or She goes on a diet every winter.</p> <p>The graphic to the right illustrates the spatio-temporal        relationship of a noun or verbal concept in the INCEPTIVE to the context at-hand (i.e., the spatio-temporal \u201cpresent\u201d).

It would    be used in translating the words water, story, and arrival in the sentences There\u2019s no water (i.e., we ran out), I like      the end of that story, and We await your arrival. With verbs,    it is illustrated by the sentences It finished molting or She\u2019s      come off her diet.</p> <p>The graphic to the right illustrates the spatio-temporal          relationship of a noun or verbal concept in the TERMINATIVE to the context at-hand (i.e., the spatio-temporal \u201cpresent\u201d).

Essentially, it applies to any context involving actual or figurative fading.    It would be used in translating the words water, strength,    and twilight in the sentences He drank the last of the water, I      have little strength left, She disappeared into the twilight. With verbs,    it is exemplified by the phrases to wind down, to fade out, to disappear      gradually and similar notions, e.g., She\u2019s eating less and less        these days.</p> <p>The graphic to the right illustrates the spatio-temporal          relationship of a noun or verbal concept in the DEPLETIVE to the context at-hand (i.e., the spatio-temporal \u201cpresent\u201d).

It would be used in translating the words darkness, wonder, and music in the following sentences: Darkness      came upon us, I felt a growing sense of wonder, The music was very soft at first.    With verbs it is illustrated by verbs and phrases such as to fade in, to      start gradually, to build up, and similar notions, e.g., She\u2019s        been eating more and more lately.</p> <p>The graphic to the right illustrates the spatio-temporal          relationship of a noun in the GRADUATIVE to the          context at-hand (i.e., the spatio-temporal \u201cpresent\u201d).        Examples:</p> <p> LISTEN </p> <p>           klakc\u2019\u00e1 \u2018the headwaters of a river\u2019 </p> <p>p\u0161a\u0148sk\u2019 \u2018a gradually developing situation\u2019</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3.5 ESSENCE <p>Essence refers to a two-fold morphological distinction which    has no counterpart in Western languages. It is best explained by reference to    various English language illustrations. Compare the following pairs of English    sentences:</p> <p> 1a) The boy ran off to sea.     1b) The boy who ran off to sea didn\u2019t run off to sea.</p> <p>2a) The dog you saw is to be sold tomorrow.     2b) The dog you saw doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>Sentences (1a) and (2a) appear to be straightforward sentences    in terms of meaning and interpretation. However, at first blush, sentences    (1b) and (2b) appear nonsensical, and it is not until we consider specialized    contexts for these sentences that they make any sense. For example, (1b) would    make sense if being spoken by an author reporting a change of mind about the    plot for a story, while (2b) makes sense when spoken by a puzzled pet store    owner in whose window you earlier saw a dog that is now no longer there.</p> <p>Why sentences such as (1b) and (2b) can have possible real-world    meaning is because they in fact do not make reference to an actual boy or dog,    but rather to hypothetical representations of a real-world boy and dog, being    used as references back to those real-world counterparts from within an \u201calternative    mental space\u201d created psychologically (and implied linguistically) where    events can be spoken about that are either unreal, as-yet-unrealized, or alternative    versions of what really takes place. This alternative mental space, then, is    essentially the psychological realm of both potential and imagination. In Western    languages, such an alternative mental space is implied by context or indicated    by certain lexical signals. One such group of lexical signals are the so-called    \u201cmodal\u201d verbs of English, e.g., must, can, should, etc.    as seen in the following:</p> <p>3) You must come home at once.     4) That girl can sing better than anybody.     5) We should attack at dawn.</p> <p>Each of the above three sentences describe potential events,    not actual real-world happenings that are occurring or have occurred. For example,    in Sentence (3) no one has yet come home nor do we know whether coming home    is even possible, in Sentence (4) the girl may never sing a single note ever    again for all we know, and Sentence (5) gives us no information as to whether    any attack will actually occur. </p> 3.5.1 NRM The Normal RPV The Representative <p>The Ithkuil category of Essence explicitly distinguishes real-world    actualities from their alternative, imagined or potential counterparts. The    two essences are termed NORMAL and REPRESENTATIVE,    the former being the default essence denoting real-world nouns and verbs, the    latter denoting alternative counterparts. By marking such counterparts explicitly,    Ithkuil allows a speaker to express any noun or verb as referring to a real-world    versus alternative manifestation, without having the listener infer such from    an explanatory context.</p> <p>Essence is as part of the Ca affix which also indicates Configuration, Affiliation and Perspective.

LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 3.6 CONTEXT <p>Context is yet another morphological category with no equivalent    in other languages. It indicates what tangible or intangible features or aspects    of a formative are being psychologically implied in any given utterance.

Similarly excluded from consideration in the EXISTENTIAL is any notion of a noun\u2019s use, function, role or benefit. The EXISTENTIAL serves only to point out the mere existence of a noun as a tangible, objective    entity under discussion. It is thus used to offer mere identification of a noun    or verb.  <p>For example, consider the sentence A cat ran past the doorway.    If the Ithkuil words corresponding to cat, run, and doorway are in the EXISTENTIAL, then the sentence merely describes    an objective scene. No implication is intended concerning the subjective nature    of the two entities or the action involved. The sentence is merely stating that    two entities currently have a certain dynamic spatial relationship to each other;    those two entities happen to be a cat and a doorway, and the running merely    conveys the nature of the spatial relationship.</p> <p>     Ilma\u0161q\u00f4n.

Likewise, the verb \u2018ran\u2019 in the FUNCTIONAL now implies the furtive nature of the cat. Example: </p> <p>     Ilma\u0161q\u00f4ni.\u00a0 DYN-\u2018play music\u2019-NRM/DEL/M/COA/CST-AGC<sub>2</sub>/7-FNC-IFL \u2018The orchestra is playing.\u2019\u00a0 [focus on  the personal meaning/importance of the event]</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3.6.3 RPS The Representational    The REPRESENTATIONAL context focuses on a formative as a symbol, metaphor, or metonym*, in that it indicates    that the formative is serving as a representation or substitute for some other    concept or entity which is abstractly associated with it. For example, the metaphorical    connotations of the English sentence That pinstripe-suited dog is checking      out a kitty, can be equally conveyed in Ithkuil by inflecting the words    for \u2018dog and \u2018kitty\u2019 into the REPRESENTATIONAL context. The REPRESENTATIONAL is one of several ways that    Ithkuil overtly renders all metaphorical, symbolic, or metonymic usages (from    a grammatical standpoint).  <p>* Metonymy    is the use of a word or phrase of one type to refer to an associated word or    phrase of a different type (usually a person), such as place-for-person in \u2018The    orders came from the White House,\u2019 object-for-person in \u2018Tell    the cook the ham-and-cheese wants fries with his order\u2019 or phrase-for-person    as in \u2018You-know-who just showed up.\u2019</p> <p> Ilma\u0161q\u00f4ne.\u00a0  DYN-\u2018play music\u2019-NRM/DEL/M/COA/CST-AGC<sub>2</sub>/7-RPS-IFL \u2018The orchestra is playing.\u2019\u00a0 [connotes  that sentence is a metaphor, e.g., \u2018life as a symphony\u2019]</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3.6.4 AMG The Amalgamative <p>The AMALGAMATIVE context  is the most abstract and difficult to understand from a Western   linguistic perspective. It focuses on the systemic, holistic, gestalt-like,   componential nature of a formative, implying that its objective and subjective   totality is derived synergistically from (or as an emergent property of) the   interrelationships between all of its parts, not just in terms of a static   momentary appraisal, but in consideration of the entire developmental history of   the noun and any interactions and relationships it has (whether past, present or   potential) within the larger context of the world. Its use indicates the speaker   is inviting the hearer to subjectively consider all the subjective wonder,   emotional nuances, psychological ramifications and/or philosophical implications   associated with the noun\u2019s existence, purpose, or function, as being a world   unto itself, intrinsically interconnected with the wider world beyond it on many   levels. Thus the AMALGAMATIVE version of our sentence The   cat ran past the doorway would take on quite melodramatic implications,   with the cat being representative of everything about cats and all they stand   for, the doorway as being representative of the nature of doorways as portals of   change, thresholds of departure, and the juncture of past and the future, while   the act of running becomes representative of flight from enemies, rapidity of   movement, the body at maximum energy expenditure, etc.</p> <p>     Ilma\u0161q\u00f4nu.\u00a0 DYN-\u2018play music\u2019-NRM/DEL/M/COA/CST-AGC<sub>2</sub>/7-AMG-IFL \u2018The orchestra is playing.\u2019\u00a0 [connotes a  focus on the emotional impact plus cultural significance of the event] </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 3.7 DESIGNATION <p>Designation is a somewhat subjective category,    with no equivalent in Western languages. It refers to a two-fold distinction in a formative regarding its contextual    status, authority, permanence, or extra-contextual relevance. The two Designations    are the INFORMAL and the FORMAL,  shown by the formative\u2019s syllabic stress (in conjunction with the verbal category of Relation which will be discussed in Section 5.4).</p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction     (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR       Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

It is best illustrated by comparative examples with the FORMAL designation in the section immediately below. </p> <p> </p> 3.7.2 FML The   Formal <p>The FORMAL designation is shown by either  ultimate (final) or pre-antepenultimate (fourth-from last) syllabic stress on the formative, depending on the formative\u2019s Relation (see Section 5.4 on Relation).</p> <p>The FORMAL designation imparts a sense of   permanency and/or authority, raising the noun or verb to a more definitive,   formal or institutional manifestation of itself, or stressing this   authoritative/definitive nature if the meaning already includes it. For example,   stems translatable as \u2018symbol,\u2019 \u2018eat,\u2019 \u2018thought,\u2019 and \u2018a model\u2019 in the INFORMAL would become \u2018icon,\u2019 \u2018dine,\u2019 \u2018idea,\u2019 and \u2018archetype\u2019 in   the FORMAL.</p> <p>The FORMAL achieves several subtle purposes   from a lexico-semantic standpoint. While some Ithkuil words would translate the   same in English no matter which designation (e.g., to hurt, to float,   breath, to fall, shade, sleep, cough), many stems would have different   translations in English depending on their designation. For example, the stem eq- with the   affiliated meanings person \u2192 group \u2192 gathering \u2192 crowd \u2192 throng, etc. in the INFORMAL   designation would change to the following series of approximate translations   when placed in the FORMAL designation: official \u2192 team \u2192 association/congregation \u2192 assembly \u2192 masses, etc.</p> <p>Further examples of lexical shifts in translation due to INFORMAL \u2192 FORMAL designation are listed   below:</p> to grow something \u2192 to cultivate wander \u2192 travel obtain/get \u2192 procure/requisition lake \u2192 reservoir (natural) holder \u2192 container see \u2192 observe to create \u2192 construct/build heap \u2192 pile animal \u2192 domesticated animal a thought \u2192 an idea natural environment \u2192\u201cman-made\u201d environment awareness \u2192 consciousness [natural] exchange \u2192 trade/commerce house \u2192 home assortment of animals \u2192 zoo collection  grouping \u2192 set to group/gather \u2192 collect wall \u2192 barrier get some exercise \u2192 to work out placidity \u2192 peace problem situation \u2192 crisis to populate \u2192 to settle <p>As can be seen from the above list, the exact interpretation of   Designation for each word-root is specific to each word-root, depending on its   associated semantic context.</p>    3.7.3 Examples of Designation in Use <p>INFORMAL</p> <p>FORMAL</p> <p>           klal \u2018flow of water; to   flow\u2019</p> \u2192 <p>       akl\u00e1l \u2018river; to flow as a river   \u2019</p> <p>           dyal              \u2018sensation/feeling;   to sense (affective)\u2019</p> \u2192 <p>         ady\u00e1l          \u2018sensation/feeling   (volitional/deliberate); to examine via the senses\u2019</p> <p>           stal \u2018comparison; to   compare/contrast\u2019</p> \u2192        ast\u00e1l \u2018measure(ment)\u2019 <p> </p> <p></p> 3.8 NOTE ON MORPHO-PHONOLOGICAL AGREEMENT  <p>In regard to the gender categories from other languages,    Ithkuil has no distinctions of gender (e.g., masculine, feminine, neuter, etc.). There is no \u201cagreement\u201d or morpho-phonological    concord of any kind between a noun and other words or morphological elements    in a sentence, i.e., there is none of the required matching of masculine or    feminine or singular/plural agreement between nouns, articles, and adjectives  as found in most Western languages. </p>"},{"location":"4/","title":"4 Cases","text":"A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 4: Case Morphology <p>   In this chapter, we analyze one additional morphological category:    Case. Like the seven categories analyzed in the previous chapter, and unlike    other languages, the category of Case applies to all formatives in Ithkuil,    i.e., to both nouns and verbs alike. However, the syntactical context in which    Case operates is sufficiently dissimilar for nouns and verbs to warrant separate    analysis. In this chapter, we will analyze the case morphology of nouns alone.    The use of Case with verbs will be analyzed in Section  5.2.</p> <p>Anyone who has studied German, Latin, Russian, Classical Greek    or Sanskrit, is familiar with the concept of Case. Case generally refers to    a morphological scheme in which a noun, whether via internal mutation of its    phonemes or via affixes, shows what grammatical \u201crole\u201d it plays    in the phrase or sentence in which it appears. For example, in the English sentence It was me she saw, the use of the word \u2018she\u2019 as opposed    to \u2018her\u2019 and the use of \u2018me\u2019 as opposed to \u2018I\u2019    distinguishes the subject of the sentence (the person seeing) from the object    of the verb (the one being seen). Similarly, in the German sentence Der      Bruder des Knaben sah den Mann (= \u2018The boy\u2019s brother saw the    man\u2019), the words \u2018der\u2019, \u2018des\u2019 and \u2018den\u2019    distinguish the subject of the sentence \u2018brother\u2019 (nominative case)    from the possessor \u2018boy\u2019 (genitive case) from the object \u2018man\u2019    (accusative case).</p> <p>The concept of \u201ccase\u201d can extend far beyond the    notions of subject, object and possessor. Depending on the particular language,    there may be noun cases which specify the location or position of a noun, whether    a noun accompanies another or derives from another or is the recipient of another.    In general, noun cases in those languages which rely upon them often substitute    for what in English is accomplished using prepositions or prepositional phrases.    The process of adding affixes or changing the phonetic structure of a word in    order to show a noun in a particular case is known as declining a noun, and    the various permutations of a noun into its cases are known as its declensions. </p> <p>There are 96 cases in Ithkuil, comprising 72 main cases, and 24 Comparison cases.  The Comparison cases  serve  specialized functions  associated with the verbal category called Level and are discussed separately in  Section 6.2.4.  The  72 main cases are dealt with in this chapter.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.1        SEMANTIC ROLE VERSUS POSITIONAL SLOT <p>In most languages, case operates at the surface structure level    of language to signify arbitrary grammatical relations such as subject, direct    object, indirect object. The deeper level of \u201csemantic role\u201d is    ignored in terms of morphological designations. The notion of semantic role    can be illustrated by the following set of sentences:</p> <p>(1a) John opened the door with the key.     (1b) The key opened the door.     (1c) The wind opened the door.     (1d) The door opened.</p> <p>In each of these sentences case is assigned based on \u201cslot\u201d,    i.e., the position of the nouns relative to the verb, irrespective of their    semantic roles. Thus the \u201csubjects\u201d of the sentences are, respectively, John, the key, the wind, and the door. Yet    it can be seen that, semantically speaking, these four sentences are interrelated    in a causal way. Specifically, Sentence (1b) results directly from sentence    (1a), and sentence (1d) results directly from either (1b) or (1c). We see that    the case of the noun \u2018key\u2019 in sentence (1a) is prepositional, while    in sentence (1b) it is the subject. Yet, the key plays the same semantic role    in both sentences: the physical instrument by which the act of opening is accomplished.    As for the noun \u2018door,\u2019 it is marked as a direct object in the first    three sentences and as a subject in the fourth, even though its semantic role    in all four sentences never changes, i.e., it is the noun which undergoes a    change in its state as a result of the act of opening. The noun \u2018John\u2019    in sentence (1a) is marked as a subject, the same case as \u2018key\u2019    in (1b), the \u2018wind\u2019 in (1c) and the \u2018door\u2019 in (1d),    yet the semantic role of \u2018John\u2019 is entirely different than the role    of \u2018key\u2019 in (1b) and different again from \u2018door\u2019 in    (1c), i.e., John is acting as the conscious, deliberate initiator of the act    of opening. Finally, the noun \u2018wind\u2019 in (1c), while marked as a    subject, operates in yet another semantic role distinct from the subjects of    the other sentences, i.e., an inanimate, blind force of nature which, while    being the underlying cause of the act of opening, can make no conscious or willed    choice to initiate such action.</p>      4.1.1 Case as Indicator of Semantic Role <p>The case structures of Western languages mark positional slot    (i.e., grammatical relations) only, and have no overt way to indicate semantic    role, thus providing no way of showing the intuitive causal relationship between    sets of sentences like those above. In Ithkuil, however, the case of a noun    is based on its underlying semantic role, not its syntactic position in the    sentence relative to the verb. These semantic roles reflect a more fundamental    or primary level of language irrespective of the surface case marking of nouns    in other languages. Thus Ithkuil noun declension more accurately reflects the    underlying semantic function of nouns in sentences. Consequently, the Western    grammatical notions of \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d have little    meaning or applicability in Ithkuil grammar.</p> <p>The following semantic roles are marked by noun cases in Ithkuil.    They correspond roughly to the \u201csubjects\u201d and \u201cobjects\u201d    of Western languages:</p> <p>AGENT: The animate, (and usually conscious    and deliberate) initiator of an act which results in another noun undergoing    a consequent change in state or behavior, e.g., \u2018John\u2019 in Sentence    (1a) above.</p> <p>FORCE: An inanimate, unwilled cause of an    act such as a force of nature like \u2018wind\u2019 in Sentence (1c) above.</p> <p>INSTRUMENT: The noun which functions as the    physical means or tool by which an act is initiated or performed, e.g., \u2018key\u2019    in Sentences (1a) and (1b) above.</p> <p>PATIENT: The noun which undergoes a change    in state or behavior as a result of an act initiated or caused by itself or    by another noun, e.g., \u2018door\u2019 in all four sentences above.</p>      4.1.2 Additional Semantic Roles <p>Additional semantic roles corresponding to subjects and objects    in Western languages exist in Ithkuil as overt noun cases. These include the    roles of ENABLER, EXPERIENCER, STIMULUS, RECIPIENT, and CONTENT, and are explained    below using the following set of sentences as illustrations.</p> <p>(2a) Mary hits the children.     (2b) Mary entertains the children.     (2c) Mary sees the children.     (2d) Mary tells the children a story.     (2e) Mary wants children.</p> <p>Examining these five sentences, we notice that the noun Mary    is in the subject slot in all of them and the children is the direct object    (except in the fourth sentence), even though the semantic roles of both nouns    are entirely different in each of these five sentences. Beginning with Sentence    (2a) we see that Mary is an AGENT which tangibly causes injury or pain to the    children who obviously function in the role of PATIENT. Thus (2a) is identical    to sentence (1a) in terms of the roles portrayed by the subject and direct object. </p> <p>In Sentence (2b) however, Mary entertains the    children, there is a subtle distinction. At first we might consider Mary    an agent who initiates a change in the children (i.e., the fact that they become    entertained). But, in fact, the act of entertainment is not one whose result    (enjoyment by the audience) can be guaranteed by the party doing the entertaining.    In fact, the result of the act of entertainment is not Mary\u2019s to determine,    but rather the children\u2019s, based on whether they \u201cfeel\u201d a    sense of enjoyment at experiencing Mary\u2019s act. And so, Mary is more like    a patient here, not an agent, as she is undergoing a change in her state or    behavior (she is performing an attempt to entertain) which she herself has chosen    to initiate and undergo, yet the act has the potential to cause a resulting    change in the children, the success of this motivation to be determined by the    children, however, not Mary. Such a semantic role as Mary here is termed an    ENABLER. And how do the children make the decision as to whether they are entertained    or not (i.e., what is their semantic role?). Can the children deliberately or    consciously choose to feel a sense of enjoyment, or are they not themselves    unwilling \u201cpatients\u201d to their own emotional reactions? In case grammar,    a party such as the children who undergo an unwilled experience are termed EXPERIENCERS.    Besides emotional reactions, such unwilled experiences include autonomic sensory    perceptions (e.g., parties that see or hear because their eyes were open and    pointed in a particular direction or who were within earshot of a sound), and    autonomic bodily reactions or responses as well as proprioceptive sensations    (e.g., coughing, sneezing, perspiring, feeling hot or cold, feeling pain, etc.).</p> <p>This notion of EXPERIENCER is likewise illustrated by Sentence    (2c) Mary sees the children, in which the verb \u2018see\u2019 denotes    an automatic sensory experience, not a deliberately initiated action. In other    words, it is the nature of the sense of sight to function automatically whenever    a person is conscious and his/her eyes are open. The verb \u2018see\u2019    does not necessarily imply a conscious or deliberately willed action of \u201cseeing\u201d    (as would be implied by the verb \u2018to look [at]\u2019). Therefore, the    \u201caction\u201d is automatic and uninitiated; it is, in fact, not an action    at all, but rather an experiential state which the person doing the seeing undergoes.    In other words, the person seeing is actually a kind of \u201cpatient,\u201d    as it is he/she who undergoes the experience of (and physical or emotional reaction    to) the particular sight. Such undergoers of sensory verbs and other unwilled    states (e.g., emotional states or reactions, autonomic bodily reactions such    as sneezing, physical states of sensation such as being hot or cold, etc.) are    categorized in the role of EXPERIENCERS. And what of the children\u2019s role    in sentence (2c)? Unlike the first three sentences, the children do not undergo    any action. Certainly the process of \u201cbeing seen\u201d by Mary does not    in itself cause a physical change or reaction of any kind in the entity being    seen. Nor can the children be analyzed as \u201cinitiating\u201d the act of    sight, as they may be completely unaware that Mary is seeing them. As a result,    the children\u2019s semantic role is merely that of STIMULUS, a neutral, unwitting    originating reason for the experiential state being undergone by the other noun    participant.</p> <p>In Sentence (2d) Mary tells the children a story,    Mary is a patient who initiates the action which she herself undergoes, the    telling of a story. The children do not undergo an unwilled emotional, sensory,    or bodily reaction here, but rather are the passive and more or less willing    RECIPIENT of information, the role of an \u201cindirect object\u201d in Western    languages. The story, on the other hand, is merely a non-participatory abstract    referent, whose role is termed CONTENT.</p> <p>The role of CONTENT also applies to the children in Sentence    (2e) Mary wants children, where they function as the \u201cobject\u201d    of Mary\u2019s desire. Since no tangible action is occurring, nor are the children    undergoing any result of change of state, nor need they be even aware of Mary\u2019s    desire, they are, like the story in sentence (2d), merely non-participatory    referents. As for Mary\u2019s role in (2e), the emotional state of desire,    being unwilled, self-activating, and subjectively internal, creates a situation    similar to an automatic sensory perception or autonomic body response; thus,    Mary\u2019s role is again that of EXPERIENCER. </p> <p> 4.1.3 Argument Structure</p> <p>In addition to case being based on semantic roles, Ithkuil  differs in another important respect from natural languages in that it does not  have a default argument structure for its verbal formatives.\u00a0 This is explained below. </p> <p>The individual verbs of natural languages each have an  implied argument structure, i.e., a pattern of how nouns (i.e., \u201carguments\u201d) interact  with the particular verb and what formal role (from a morpho-semantic  perspective) each of those nouns plays in relation to the verb.\u00a0 For example, the verb \u201chit\u201d in English  implies the existence of an agent (i.e., someone doing the hitting) and a  patient (i.e., someone undergoing the effect/result of the hitting),  as in \u201cHe hit the dog.\u201d\u00a0 A different  argument structure is illustrated by the verb \u201cgive\u201d which implies an agent  doing the giving, a patient undergoing the receiving, and a noun functioning in  the semantic role of content, i.e., the item being given/received.</p> <p>The grammar of natural languages specifies the requirements  of which arguments to a verb must be present for a sentence to be grammatical  and which arguments are optional.\u00a0 This  is illustrated, for example, in the following English sentences (ungrammatical  sentences are preceded by an asterisk):\u00a0 </p> <p>3a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sam gave the  girl a book.     3b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sam gave a book.     3c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sam gave.     3d)\u00a0 * Sam gave the  girl.\u00a0 (Intended meaning:\u00a0 Sam  gave something to the girl.)     3e)\u00a0 * Gave the girl a  book.\u00a0 (Intended meaning:\u00a0 The  girl was given a book or Someone gave  the girl a book.)     3f)\u00a0 * Gave the  girl.\u00a0 (Intended meaning:\u00a0 The  girl was given something, or Someone  gave something to the girl.)     3g)\u00a0 * Gave a  book.\u00a0 (Intended meaning:\u00a0 Someone  gave a book.)     3h)\u00a0 * Gave.\u00a0 (Intended meaning:\u00a0 Someone  did some giving, or Giving occurred). </p> <p>In sentence (3a), all three arguments to the verb \u201cgave\u201d are  expressed, while in sentence (3b) the patient/recipient has been deleted.\u00a0 Sentence (3c) deletes both the  patient/recipient and the CONTENT argument.\u00a0  In sentence (3d) however, when we try to delete the CONTENT argument of  book while preserving the patient/recipient, the sentence requires syntactic  restructuring into Sam gave [something]  to the girl in order to remain grammatical (the asterisk * in front of the  sentence indicates it is ungrammatical). \u00a0Likewise, sentences (3e), (3f), (3g) and (3h) are  ungrammatical when we try to delete the agent, as well as either or both of the  other two arguments as well, requiring paraphrasing to make the intended  meaning grammatical). </p> <p>Compare the above group of sentence containing the verb  \u2018gave\u2019 with the sentences below featuring the verb \u2018broke\u2019:</p> <p>4a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tim broke the  window with a hammer.     4b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tim broke the  window.     4c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The hammer  broke the window.     4d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The window  broke.     4e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The hammer  broke.\u00a0 (Intended meaning:\u00a0 The  hammer broke something.)     4f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Tim  broke.\u00a0 (Intended meaning:\u00a0 Tim  broke something, or Tim did some  breaking.)</p> <p>Notice how sentence (3c) above, Sam gave, is grammatical, but the similarly structured sentence  (4f) Tim broke is not.\u00a0 Conversely, notice in comparing sentences (4a)  and (4d) that the patient window is  grammatical in both object and subject slots, but similarly placing the patient girl from sentence (3a) into subject  slot gives the ungrammatical sentence *The  girl gave (with intended meaning:\u00a0 The girl was given something or Someone gave the girl something.)</p> <p>Other examples of constraints on argument structure in  English are illustrated as follows:</p> <p>Bill cut the cake with  a knife can be shortened to Bill cut  the cake, but the syntactically identical She put the book on the shelf cannot be shortened to *She put the book.</p> <p>Treatment healed my  wounds can delete its agent to give My  wounds healed, but the similar Treatment  cured my wounds does not allow agent-deletion to *My wounds cured.</p> <p>As can be seen, languages such as English are very haphazard  in the various constraints on argument structure applied to individual  verbs.\u00a0 Sometimes it is possible to  delete arguments but at other times doing so results in an ungrammatical  sentence, even though a semantically equivalent paraphrase exists. Ithkuil has  no such constraints on its argument structure.\u00a0  As long as a sentence makes sense semantically and the relationships  between explicit or implied arguments and their verb can be determined or inferred,  then the Ithkuil sentence will be grammatically permissible.\u00a0 This is possible because nouns in Ithkuil are  marked for semantically-based case, as well as the fact that verbs are marked  for Function, a category we will explore Section 5.1. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.2 MORPHO-PHONOLOGICAL        MARKERS FOR CASE <p>Case is shown in  different ways in Ithkuil depending on    whether the case  is being manifested in conjunction with a formative or a personal    reference adjunct (explained in Section      8.1).

However, if the formative\u2019s Vr affix  can be deleted from Slot IV, then optionally, V takes the value of the Vr affix and the Vr affix is deleted from Slot IV, e.g., opral declined into the SML case becomes either opra\u2019al or pra\u2019ol.</p> <p> For personal reference adjuncts, which correspond roughly to personal pronouns in other languages,  case markers are dependent on various factors, as explained in Section  8.1.  </p> <p>We are now in a position to examine the different noun cases    in detail. We will start with the group of cases which correspond to \u201csubjects\u201d  and \u201cobjects\u201d in Western languages.</p> <p> </p>       4.3 THE TRANSRELATIVE CASES <p>The Transrelative cases refer to eleven cases used to identify    nouns functioning as participants to a verb, what in Western grammatical terms    would be referred to as \u201csubjects\u201d and \u201cobjects\u201d and    most likely marked as either nominative, accusative, or dative. It is these    cases which more or less correspond to the semantic roles identified in Sec.      4.1 above. The eleven transrelative cases are the OBLIQUE,        ABSOLUTIVE, DATIVE, ERGATIVE, EFFECTUATIVE, INDUCIVE, AFFECTIVE, INSTRUMENTAL,        ACTIVATIVE, DERIVATIVE, and SITUATIVE. Following  are explanations of the function and usage of each case. </p> <p>Actual Ithkuil examples    of these cases in use are provided in Section 4.3.12. </p> <p> </p> 4.3.1 OBL The Oblique Case <p>The OBLIQUE case is marked by the Vc value -a-. As described above in Section 4.1.2, the OBLIQUE identifies the semantic role of CONTENT, whether it is something given to a    RECIPIENT, or the non-causal abstract content of an experiential state, e.g.,    a memory recalled, something desired, something feared. It would thus be used    in translating sentences such as Sam gave me a book, The      child likes cereal. It is also the case associated with    existential identification, what in English would be the subject of the verb    \u2018to be\u2019 when referring to the intrinsic identity or static description    of a noun as in the English sentences That boy is blind or The house was built of wood. The OBLIQUE,    being the semantically most neutral case, is also the citation form of a noun    (i.e., the form in which the noun would be listed in a dictionary). </p> <p></p> <p> </p> 4.3.2 IND The Inducive Case <p>The INDUCIVE case is marked by the Vc value -u-. The INDUCIVE identifies a noun which    undergoes a self-initiated action, i.e., the noun is a PATIENT of an agential    action in which the AGENT and the PATIENT are the same. Note that this does    not necessarily imply reflexive action (i.e., doing something to oneself). It    would be used in sentences such as The boy jumped, He sang, The dog barked all night, or She danced to the music, in which the party initiating and performing the action    are one and the same. </p> <p> </p> 4.3.3 ABS The Absolutive Case <p>The ABSOLUTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -e-. As described in Section 4.1.1 above, the ABSOLUTIVE identifies the semantic role of PATIENT of an agential action, where the agent-initiator    is a different party than the patient who undergoes the resulting action. Note    that in sentences with patient subjects, the agent or instrument of agency need    not be overtly expressed. Examples of English sentences translatable using the ABSOLUTIVE would be The boy hit the girl,      She forced him to do it, The bird fell from      the sky, The prisoner died during the gun battle.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.3.4 ERG The Ergative Case <p>The ERGATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -o-. The ERGATIVE identifies the semantic    role of AGENT, i.e., a noun which initiates a tangible action undergone by another    party (the PATIENT), as described in Section 4.1.1.    Note that sentences involving an ERGATIVE agent need not    overtly express the patient noun. Examples of English sentences translatable    using the ERGATIVE would be The boy      hit the girl, She forced him to do it, That murderer kills for fun.</p> <p> </p> 4.3.5 EFF The Effectuative Case <p>The EFFECTUATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00f6-. The EFFECTUATIVE identifies the noun    acting in the semantic role of ENABLER, as described in Section      4.1.2 above. This is the noun which initiates a causal chain of events,    ultimately resulting in a final event. An example would be pulling out the plug    of a filled bathtub thereby causing it to empty. This case should therefore    be carefully distinguished from the ERGATIVE case. Ergatively    marked nouns imply that the action undergone by the patient is the same action    directly initiated by the agent, whereas EFFECTUATIVE nouns imply a chain or series of cause-and-effect actions. For example, in the    Ithkuil translation of the sentence The clown emptied the blood from the      tub, the clown could be marked either as an AGENT by means of the ERGATIVE case, or as an ENABLER using the EFFECTUATIVE case. The    former would mean the clown poured out the blood himself, while the latter would    mean he let it drain (i.e., by pulling the plug). Such case distinctions eliminate    the need for Ithkuil to have separate verbs for \u2018to drain,\u2019 \u2018to    pour\u2019 or \u2018to empty.\u2019 The Ithkuil verb used in translating    the sentence would simply mean \u2018to remove.\u2019</p> <p>Note that the EFFECTUATIVE case is commonly used with the ENB affix  -ls to show the degree or nature of the enabling cause. With this suffix, sentences    can be produced which specify whether the enablement is via giving of consent    or permission, by persuasion, by subtle indirect influence, by removal of a    hindrance, or even by inaction. </p> <p> </p> 4.3.6 AFF The Affective Case <p>The AFFECTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -i-. The AFFECTIVE denotes a noun whose    semantic role is that of EXPERIENCER, as described previously in Section      4.1.2, the noun which undergoes a non-causal, non-initiated (and unwilled)    experiential state, whether internally autonomic in nature or as the result    of an external stimulus. Examples of such states would be automatic sensory    experience; autonomic bodily reactions such as yawning, sneezing, coughing,    blinking, itching, feeling sleepy, pain, feeling ill, feeling cold or warm;    automatic reactions to external stimuli such as shock, flinching, ducking, raising    one\u2019s arms to avoid sudden danger; as well as any unwilled emotional state    such as love, hate, fear, anger, surprise, joy, wistfulness, shyness, regret,    anxiety, etc. </p> <p>Example sentences requiring the use of the AFFECTIVE case would be The baby is coughing, The lightning startled her, Mortimer loves his vittles, Uncle    Davey slept till noon, My back itches me.</p> <p>Note that if the experiential state is willfully brought about    by the noun undergoing it, the INDUCIVE case would be    used, since the noun is deliberately initiating an action in order to induce    the experiential state. For example, compare the sentence The children smiled with glee (marked using the AFFECTIVE)    with The children smiled on cue (marked using the INDUCIVE).</p> <p> </p> 4.3.7 DAT The Dative Case <p>The DATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00fc- or, if the Cr root ends in a -w or -y, it is marked by  the Vc value -ae\u2019-. The DATIVE has two functions in Ithkuil.    Similarly to Western languages, it marks indirect objects of verbs of giving    and telling, i.e., the semantic role of RECIPIENT of a noun transferred via    an act of giving, donation, lending, or other transference of possession, or    the hearer to who something is said, told, recounted, etc, as described in Section      4.1.2 above. Secondly, like some Western languages (e.g., Russian), Ithkuil    uses a dative construction in lieu of any verb \u2018to have\u2019 in reference    to possession or attribution. It would therefore be used in translating sentences    such as We're giving you a present, Jason lent a dollar to his sister, Please grant me a wish, The      student has three books, Those mountains have a mysterious      quality. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.3.8 INS The Instrumental Case <p> The INSTRUMENTAL case is marked by the Vc value -ai-. As described previously in Section 4.1.1,    the INSTRUMENTAL denotes a noun which functions as the    INSTRUMENT or means utilized by an AGENT in accomplishing an action or bringing    about a state. It is usually translated by English \u2018with.\u2019 Examples    of usage would be She killed him with a knife, The man      tripped over my foot, The password got him      inside. The INSTRUMENTAL is also used to mark translations    of an inanimate \u201csubject\u201d noun when its logical function is as the    instrument of an unstated agent, e.g., compare I pressed the button with      my finger with My finger pressed the button,    both of which would be identical in Ithkuil except for the latter sentence\u2019s    missing agent, I.</p> <p>Note that the INSTRUMENTAL does not translate    \u2018with\u2019 in its meaning of \u2018along with\u2019 or \u2018accompanied    by\u2019 (see the COMITATIVE case below in Sec.      4.5.20) as in She arrived with her father. Nor is it used to show    the resources or materials consumed in performing an act. For example, in the    sentence He cooks with tomatoes (see the COMPOSITIVE case in Sec. 4.5.3), it is not the tomatoes that cook    the food, therefore the INSTRUMENTAL would not be used,    whereas in He fueled the fire with wood it is the wood that fuels the    fire, thus requiring the INSTRUMENTAL case.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.3.9 ACT The Activative Case <p>The ACTIVATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ei-. The ACTIVATIVE identifies a noun engaged    in or subject to a mental or metaphysical state which, as a concurrent result,    creates a hypothetical, \u201cunrealized\u201d situation which can potentially    be made real by further action. Such unrealized situations can be illustrated    by the sentence Frank must go to Chicago, in which no actual travel    to Chicago has occurred and, in fact, may not occur. Similarly, in the sentence Mother needs to rest, no resting has yet occurred and may not. In both    sentences, the event which would \u201cfulfill\u201d the state described remains    an unrealized hypothetical, at least from the perspective of the speaker. Similar    hypothetical events or states are found in the sentences The students want      you to sing, Everyone expected you to laugh, or Joe will demand that I stay.    Note that many of these constructions in English involve the use of \u201cmodal\u201d    verbs such as want, need, can, must, etc. </p> <p>Notice that the subject of these English sentences (Frank,    Mother, the students, everyone, Joe) are functioning neither as AGENTS    nor PATIENTS, since the modal verbs of which they are the subject do not identify    as-yet actualized events, only states of unrealized potential. These subjects    are essentially EXPERIENCERS undergoing a mental or metaphysical state of wanting,    needing, obligation, expectation, hoping, wishing, being able to, etc. However,    such experiencers must be differentiated from would-be experiencers \u201cwithin\u201d    the hypothetical situation. For example, in the sentence Sam wants Shirley      to love him, it could become ambiguous if Sam and Shirley are both marked    as EXPERIENCERS using the AFFECTIVE case. Consequently,    Ithkuil uses the ACTIVATIVE case to mark the subject whose    mental or metaphysical state creates a concurrent hypothetical, as-yet unrealized    situation. All of the subjects in the example sentences from the previous paragraph    (i.e., Frank, Mother, the students, everyone, Joe) would be so marked.    In Section 6.1  we will see how the ACTIVATIVE is used in conjunction with a morphological    category for verbs termed Modality to create such hypothetical states and situations. </p> <p> </p> 4.3.10 DER The Derivative Case <p>The DERIVATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ui-. The DERIVATIVE serves two functions    in Ithkuil. Firstly, it identifies an inanimate FORCE of nature (as described    in Sec. 4.1.1) or abstract causative situation which    causes a PATIENT noun to undergo an action, as in The wind blew down the door, or Fame threatened his freedom.    The use of the DERIVATIVE instead of the ERGATIVE or the EFFECTUATIVE denotes that such inanimate agential    forces or abstract enabling situations cannot consciously or willingly initiate    actions, but rather are merely circumstantial initiating causes. Therefore the    resulting act, event, or state is seen more as having derived from this force    or situation, as opposed to being willfully or consciously caused. In this function,    a noun in the DERIVATIVE can often be translated using    phrases such as \u2018due to, owing to, on account of, because of, as a result    of.\u2019 Nouns in the DERIVATIVE can also appear in    appositive constructions (i.e., in a noun-to-noun conjunction) where the noun    in the DERIVATIVE denotes the abstract cause or reason    for the other noun, e.g., the danger of fame, love\u2019s heartache, wind song.</p> <p>The second function of the DERIVATIVE case is to identify the non-agential, unconscious or non-deliberate STIMULUS    of an affective mental state, emotion, or autonomic sensory experience, as in The coffee smells good, I saw her today,      She hates that boy, Victor coughed from the gas,      We laughed at his jokes, That song makes me      cry. Ithkuil grammar views the stimulus of an experiential state as having    a similar role to that of an abstract circumstantial or situational cause (as    in the above examples); this explains why the DERIVATIVE case serves to indicate both functions. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.3.11 SIT The Situative Case <p>The SITUATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -oi-. The SITUATIVE identifies a noun as    the background context for a clause. It is similar to the DERIVATIVE case immediately above, except it does not imply a direct causative relationship    between the background context and the act, condition, or event which occurs.

Using Case to Achieve  \u201cMiddle Voice\u201d Semantic Effects</p> <p>English (among other languages) allows some of its verbs to  operate both transitively (i.e., taking a direct object) as well as  intransitively (i.e., without a direct object), where the object of the  transitive sentence becomes the subject of the intransitive sentence.\u00a0 Furthermore, the intransitive sentence  describes the same potential event as the transitive version does, except that  no agent is expressed, the focus of the sentence being on the result, not the  act which gives rise to the result.\u00a0  Examples:</p> <p>The manager opened the store at 8  a.m.     The store opened at 8 a.m.</p> <p>Robert flies the airplane  beautifully.     The airplane flies beautifully.</p> <p>The engineer increased the  pressure.     The pressure increased.</p> <p>I molded the soft clay easily.     The soft clay molded easily.</p> <p>Note that the second sentence of each pair above is  semantically distinct from its passive voice equivalent (i.e., The store was opened at 8 a.m., The airplane  is flown beautifully, The pressure was increased, The soft clay was molded  easily) in that passives allow for the agent to be overtly stated (using the  preposition \u2018by\u2019 in English, as in The  store was opened by the manager) or, if absent, nevertheless imply the  existence of the agent.\u00a0 However, the  intransitive sentences above (equivalent to \u201cmiddle voice\u201d constructions in languages such as Swahili or Turkish) do not allow for expression of an agent  and are designed to supress the semantic relevance (or saliency) of the agent.</p> <p>However, English is very haphazard and idiosyncratic as to  what verbs it allows to operate this way, often having to resort to paraphrase  and idiomatic structures to accomplish the same effects as in the four  intransitive sentences above.\u00a0 For  example [ungrammatical sentences are preceded by an asterisk]: </p> <p> Father painted the  fence yellow.     * The fence painted yellow. (But:\u00a0 The fence came  out yellow.)</p> <p>I noticed a storm on the horizon.     * A storm noticed on the horizon. (But:\u00a0 A storm came  into view on the horizon.)</p> <p>The owner keeps scissors with the sewing supplies.     * Scissors keep with the sewing supplies. (But:\u00a0 Scissors belong/stay  with the sewing supplies.)</p> <p>Fans buy beer a lot at baseball games.     * Beer buys a lot at baseball games. (But:\u00a0 Beer sells a  lot at baseball games.)</p> <p>Of course, many English speakers would simply use the  passive voice or a construction using \u2018get\u2019 to accomplish the same thing  (i.e., The fence was/got painted yellow,  A storm was noticed on the horizon, The scissors are/get kept with the sewing  supplies, Beer is/gets bought a lot at baseball games.) without worrying  about the existence of an implied agent.\u00a0 </p> <p>Many languages utilize reflexive constructions to accomplish  this effect, e.g., Spanish Se habla  espa\u00f1ol aqu\u00ed, literally \u201cSpanish speaks itself here\u201d, meaning Spanish is spoken here.</p> <p>Ithkuil, however, can manipulate the assignment of case to  verb arguments to achieve this \u201cmiddle voice\u201d effect for any verb where it is  semantically feasible, without having to resort to idiomatic constructions or  paraphrase.\u00a0 For example:</p> <p> Aikkaldhort \u00a0\u00e2\u013cnocca\u0163. \u2018chew\u2019-easily\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018snails\u2019-ERGATIVE Snails chew easily.\u00a0 [meaning:\u00a0  It is easy for snails to chew things.] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p> <p> versus:</p> <p> Aikkaldhort\u00a0 \u00e2\u013cnecca\u0163. \u2018chew\u2019-easily\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018snails\u2019-ABSOLUTIVE Snails chew easily.\u00a0 [meaning:\u00a0  It is easy to chew (on) snails.] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LISTEN </p> <p> </p>  4.3.14 Specialized Suffixes Used to Expand the Functionality of the Transrelative    Cases <p>It should be noted that Ithkuil provides an array of suffixes specifically designed    to work in conjunction with nouns inflected into one of the Transrelative cases    to significantly expand their ability to specify the exact nature of the causal    relationships between participants to a verb in an Ithkuil sentence. These suffixes    include the Consent CNS suffix, the Reason  RSN suffix, the Expectation  XPT suffix, the Deliberateness  DLB suffix, the Enablement ENB suffix, the Agency/Intent  AGN suffix, and the Impact  IMP suffix. These affixes are detailed in Section      7.4.12 and discussed further in Section        10.1.2.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.4 THE POSESSIVE CASES <p>Those Western languages which have possessive cases usually    have only one such case, often functioning in a vague and ambiguous way to show    varying types of relationships between two nouns. For example, notice the differing    relationships expressed by the possessive in the following English sentences: </p> <p> the man\u2019s hat = the hat belonging to him [alienable possession] the man\u2019s house = the house he legally owns [proprietary responsibility] the man\u2019s arm = part of his body [inalienable component] the man\u2019s brother = the brother related to him [genetic relationship] the man\u2019s happiness = he feels happy [affective experience] the man\u2019s rescue = he was or will be rescued [target of others\u2019      purpose] the man\u2019s gift = the gift is for him [benefaction] the man\u2019s gift = the gift is from him [source] the man\u2019s world = the world in which he lives [inherent subjective      association] the man\u2019s team = the team he is associated with [interactive      mutual association] the man\u2019s story = the story about him [topical reference] the man\u2019s painting = the picture he painted [creation/authorship] the man\u2019s command = his being a commander [role or function]</p> <p>In many instances, the English possessive is totally ambiguous,    e.g., does \u2018the man\u2019s story\u2019 mean the one he wrote or the    one about him? Regarding \u2018the man\u2019s rescue,\u2019 did the man do    the rescuing or is he the one being rescued? Is \u2018the man\u2019s gift\u2019    one he is giving or receiving? Ithkuil is more exact in specifying the nature    of these relationships via case. Many of the above relationships are addressed    by the seven Possessive cases. </p> <p>The Possessive cases make a distinction between alienable    versus inalienable possession or attribution, as well as distinguishing whether    the possession is inherent to the possessor or imposed or caused from without.    These distinctions are explained below. Like Western languages (and unlike many    American Indian and North Caucasian languages), the case marking is on the possessor    noun, not the possessed. The seven Associative cases are the POSSESSIVE,      PROPRIETIVE, GENITIVE, ATTRIBUTIVE, PRODUCTIVE, INTERPRETATIVE, and ORIGINATIVE.    Following are explanations of the function and usage of each case. Actual Ithkuil    examples of the cases in use are given in Sec. 4.4.8.</p> 4.4.1 POS The Possessive Case <p>The POSSESSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00e2-. The POSSESSIVE is used to refer to    a noun which has alienable (i.e., removable or severable) possession of another    noun in the sense of having physical control or oversight of that noun, whether    by chance circumstance or deliberate manipulation. The two nouns are not in    any sense inherent parts of one another and the relationship between the two    can be theoretically or actually terminated by an outside force or influence,    or by decision of the possessor, usually by means of mere physical permanent    separation of the possessor and possessed nouns. The possessive would be used    to translate English phrases such as his coat (e.g.,    the one he is wearing, regardless of whether he owns it or not), the      boy\u2019s book (e.g., the one in his hand), Father\u2019s chair (e.g., the one he happens to be sitting in, as in a restaurant). </p> 4.4.2 PRP The Proprietive Case <p>The PROPRIETIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00ee- or alternately -\u00fb-; following Cr stems ending in -w, the Vc value is -\u00ee-, while following Cr stems ending in -y, the Vc value is -\u00fb-; after other Cr stems, either Vc value is permissible. The PROPRIETIVE identifies a noun having    alienable possession of another noun in the sense of quasi-permanent contextual    control, ownership or oversight, whether by societal recognition, social convention,    law, purchase or decree, which mere physical separation does not sever. The    two nouns are not in any sense inherent parts of one another, however the relationship    cannot be terminated except via an equally or more binding act, declaration,    convention, law, process, etc. Using the same English examples used with the POSSESSIVE above, we can analyze the connotative difference: his coat (i.e., the one he owns, regardless of whether    he is wearing it or not), the boy\u2019s book (e.g.,    the one he bought), Father\u2019s chair (e.g., the    one assigned to him). </p> 4.4.3 GEN The Genitive Case <p>The GENITIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00ea-. The GENITIVE is used to refer to a    noun which has inalienable (i.e., unremovable, unseverable) possession of or    association with another noun in the sense of having that noun as an inherent    or intrinsic attribute, characteristic, physical part, or genetic (i.e., familial)    bond, e.g., my hand, the building\u2019s doors, the child\u2019s father, the essence of that      woman. </p> 4.4.4 ATT The Attributive Case <p>The ATTRIBUTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00f4-. The ATTRIBUTIVE is used to refer to    a noun which inalienably experiences the effects of, or otherwise has an affective    (see the AFFECTIVE case above) relationship with another    noun, either as a temporary or permanent attribute, characteristic, or experience,    whether physical or psychological, objective or subjective in nature. Examples: his pain, Mother\u2019s guilt, the      child\u2019s cough, Dorothy\u2019s mood, Davey\u2019s happiness, the teacher\u2019s stubbornness, my needs. </p> 4.4.5 PDC The Productive Case <p>The PRODUCTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00ebi-. The PRODUCTIVE identifies the creator,    author or originator of another noun, e.g., the girl\u2019s poem, the clowns\u2019 plan, my statue (i.e., the one I sculpted). </p> 4.4.6 ITP The Interpretative Case <p>The INTERPRETATIVE case is marked by    the Vc value -\u00f6i-. The INTERPRETATIVE identifies a noun    acting as the subjective interpretational context of another noun, that is the    noun by or through which another noun is subjectively interpreted or described,    as exemplified by the phrases Monet\u2019s Paris, our world, life as seen by children. </p> 4.4.7 OGN The Originative Case <p>The ORIGINATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ae-. The ORIGINATIVE identifies a noun as    being the literal or figurative source of another, or which    is the native location, origin, or usual locational context for another. , e.g., the man\u2019s story (i.e., the one he told), our gift (i.e.,    the one we are giving), water from the river, the fruit of the tree, Fix the kitchen sink! (i.e. the one found in the kitchen), Desert rocks are so      beautiful (i.e., whether being spoken about rocks taken from the desert    or rocks still present in the desert), Northern women are  easy-going.</p> <p> The ORIGINATIVE     should be distinguished from the ABLATIVE in Section 4.7.5 below, in that    the ABLATIVE  position or path of motion away from,    whereas the ORIGINATIVE  merely presents a locational context    as a means of description or to distinguish the noun from an otherwise similar  noun. </p>    4.4.8 Examples of Possessive Cases in Use <p> ult\u00e1n\u013c\u00a0 \u00eamm\u00e2l  STA-\u2018page.of.writing\u2019-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/SEG/COA-FML\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STA-\u2018male child \u2019-POS-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL \u2018the boy's book\u2019 [i.e., the one he has in his immediate possession,  not one he necessarily owns]  LISTEN </p> <p> ult\u00e1n\u013c\u00a0 \u00eamm\u00fbl  STA-\u2018page.of.writing\u2019-OBL-DEL/M/SEG/COA-FML\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STA-\u2018male child \u2019-PRP-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL \u2018the boy's book\u2019 [i.e., the one he owns]  LISTEN </p> <p> \u00f6p\u0163al\u00a0 \u00e0\u00e7t\u00eal STA-\u2018interior.corner\u2019-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STA-\u2018room/chamber\u2019-GEN-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-FML \u2018corner of a room\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p> xal\u00a0 ak\u0163r\u00f4l STA-\u2018see+thing.seen\u2019-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STA-\u2018eagle\u2019-ATT-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL \u2018what the eagle sees\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p> Isval  \u00a0\u00eazguirs\u00a0 \u00e8k\u0161\u00f4t\u00a0 \u00e2mmit.

Most of these cases correspond to relationships in which, in English translation,    we find two nouns together in apposition or as a compound noun, as in cat      box, schoolbook, peace march, mountain man, etc., or joined by the word    \u2018of\u2019 in a non-possessive relationship, e.g., box of coins, dreams      of youth, sounds of laughter, or as a modifier of a verbal phrase. Following    are explanations of the function and usage of each case. Actual Ithkuil examples    of the cases in use are given in Sec. 4.5.33 .</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.1 PAR The Partitive Case <p>The PARTITIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ia- or -ua-; following Cr stems ending in -w, the Vc value is -ia-, while following Cr stems ending in -y, the Vc value is -ua-; after other Cr stems, either Vc value is permissible. When used in conjunction with another noun, the PARTITIVE indicates a quantitative or content-to-container relationship between the two    nouns, e.g., a cup of coffee, a box(ful) of books,      a train(load) of refugees. When used alone, it signifies    that the context of the phrase or sentence involves only a portion of the noun,    rather than the whole noun, e.g., I ate some bread, Pour (some) water down my back. </p> <p>The PARTITIVE is also used to mark a    noun qualified by a specific number, e.g., three boxes,      two clowns, twenty words. This usage    is analyzed in detail in Chapter      12, where we will see that, in Ithkuil, numbers are formatives (i.e.,    full nouns and verbs), not adjectives as in Western languages. Additionally,    a noun qualified by a number is not pluralized. In other words, one does not    say \u2018three boxes,\u2019 but rather \u201ca trio of a box\u201d or perhaps    more eloquently, \u201ca box trio.\u201d </p> <p>The PARTITIVE case is also used in constructing    words for Ithkuil numbers beginning with two hundred. This is also detailed    in Chapter      12 on enumeration.</p> 4.5.2 CRS The Contrastive Case <p>The CONTRASTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ie- or -ue-; following Cr stems ending in -w, the Vc value is -ie-, while following Cr stems ending in -y, the Vc value is -ue-; after other Cr stems, either Vc value is permissible. The CONTRASTIVE identifies  a noun which  has been replaced by another or for which another noun has been substituted. This is translatable by the English    phrases \u2018instead of\u2019 or \u2018rather than\u2019 or  \u2018as opposed to,\u2019 or specialized uses of \u2018not,\u2019 e.g., Instead      of rain, it snowed; They hired her as a cook, as opposed to  a maid; I prefer peas to carrots; Rather than marigolds, let\u2019s buy carnations; That's  sugar, not salt. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.3 CPS The Compositive Case <p>The COMPOSITIVE case is marked by the Vc value -io- or -uo-; following Cr stems ending in -w, the Vc value is -io-, while following Cr stems ending in -y, the Vc value is -uo-; after other Cr stems, either Vc value is permissible. The COMPOSITIVE identifies a noun as    being the literal or figurative substance or component(s) of which another is    made, composed, formed, built or comprised. Example of usage would be That      statue was carved out of marble, She owns three gold(en) coins, We were caught in a web of lies, I use a wooden ladder, It was a house of cards, Three suits comprise his wardrobe, Joe detests styrofoam cups.</p> <p>The COMPOSITIVE is also used in conjunction    with verbs to identify the material(s) or resources used up or consumed in performing    or undertaking an activity. Examples of this usage would be She likes to      cook with tomatoes, He reads by candle(light),      That child goes through four sets of clothes a day, My uncle      satisfied his sweet tooth with three chocolate bars.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.4 PRD The Predicative Case <p>The PREDICATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -i\u00f6- or -u\u00f6-; following Cr stems ending in -w, the Vc value is -i\u00f6-, while following Cr stems ending in -y, the Vc value is -u\u00f6-; after other Cr stems, either Vc value is permissible. The PREDICATIVE identifies a noun which    constitutes the non-causal basis, foundation, sustenance (literally or figuratively),    or required existential condition for another noun or clause, translatable by    the phrases \u2018based (up)on,\u2019 \u2018dependent (up)on\u2019 or \u2018relying    on.\u2019 Examples of use are a book dependent on a publisher,      a man relying on charity, laws based in reason,      Can success supported by murder be sustained?</p> <p>The PREDICATIVE should be distinguished    from Transrelative cases such as the DERIVATIVE or INSTRUMENTAL,    in that the PREDICATIVE does not denote a cause, merely    the sustaining entity on which another depends, e.g., it would not be used to    translate anxiety based on terror, as the anxiety does not \u2018rely\u2019    or \u2018depend\u2019 on terror, but rather is caused by it. Similarly, in    the phrase an attitude fueled by greed, the attitude derives from or    results from greed, but is not relying on it.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.5 MED The Mediative Case <p>The MEDIATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -a\u2019-. The MEDIATIVE indicates the physical,    psychological, or figurative medium through which another noun or event takes    place. It would be used in translating phrases or sentences such as a radio announcement, arrival by water, a letter bomb, air mail, achieving ecstasy through sex, I      showed her my love with chocolate. It should be distinguished    from the INSTRUMENTAL case (see Section 4.3.8 above),    which signifies the actual instrument or physical means used to accomplish a    causative action. For example, in the sentence Call him on the phone!,    translating the phrase on the phone into the INSTRUMENTAL case would signify \u2018Use the phone (i.e., the one in the room) to call    him,\u2019 whereas inflection into the MEDIATIVE case    would mean \u2018Call him via the medium of telephony.\u2019 </p> <p></p> <p> </p> 4.5.6 APL The Applicative Case <p>The APPLICATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -u\u2019-. The APPLICATIVE identifies a noun which    represents the purpose for which another noun is to be utilized in a given instance.    As such, it usually translates English \u2018for\u2019 when meaning \u2018for    the temporary or incidental use/purpose of.\u2019 Examples of usage would be a cup for coffee (i.e., a cup being used incidentally to hold coffee), a box for tools (i.e., the box is only temporarily being used to hold    tools), a room for changing. Note that the use of the APPLICATIVE can extend to usages beyond English \u2018for,\u2019 as in a \u201cweapon\u201d      cat = \u2018a cat used as a weapon,\u2019 or a \u201cprojectile\u201d        book = \u2018a book used as a projectile.\u2019 </p> 4.5.7 PUR The Purposive Case <p>The PURPOSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -e\u2019-. The PURPOSIVE identifies a noun which    characterizes or defines the purpose of, or reason for, another noun. The PURPOSIVE is subtly distinct from the APPLICATIVE above, in that    the latter names the actual use to which a noun is put on a given occasion or    in given context, whereas the PURPOSIVE defines another    noun\u2019s general function or primary reason for being, outside of any contextual    instance, i.e., what the noun is used for all the time (or at least its intended    use). It generally translates English \u2018as,\u2019 \u2018of\u2019 or    \u2018for\u2019 when meaning \u2018for the purpose of\u2019 or alternately    an English noun-noun expression or a compound noun. Examples of usage would    be a coffee cup, a toolbox, a litter box, a trashcan. </p> <p> </p> 4.5.8 CSD The Considerative Case <p>The CONSIDERATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -o\u2019-. The CONSIDERATIVE identifies a noun    as the delimiting or defining context in which an act, state or event occurs    or is considered. Thus, it translates English terms such as \u2018according    to,\u2019 \u2018pursuant to,\u2019 \u2018as per,\u2019 \u2018in the opinion    of.\u2019 Examples of usage would be In my opinion he\u2019s      a coward; He\u2019s leaving town as per orders from the court;      You were arrested pursuant to law; According to our        teacher, humans are descended from apes.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.9 ESS The Essive Case <p>The ESSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ea-. The ESSIVE identifies the role or name    by which a noun is known or contextually identified. It translates English \u2018as\u2019    in the sense of naming or reference to the a nouns functional identity. It would    be used in translating the English sentences They called him a clown,      The woman entered the club as an equal of any man, We consider      you our only hope. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.10 ASI The Assimilative Case <p>The ASSIMILATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -eo-. The ASSIMILATIVE identifies a noun used as    a context for analogy or metaphorical comparison to either another noun or a    verb. Thus, it translates English \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018as\u2019 in    the sense of comparison or analogy between one thing and another. Examples of    usage are She sings like a bird, As children they      seemed to me.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.11 FUN The Functive Case <p>The FUNCTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -e\u00f6-. It functions similarly to English adverbs ending in -ly or the adverbial use of with, identifying the manner in which an action,    event, or state occurs or exists. More exactly, it identifies a noun used to    characterize the manner of the act, state, or event, translatable most accurately    by the phrase \u2018in a manner characterized by\u2026.\u2019 Examples would    be: She dances gracefully (i.e., in a manner characterized    by grace), The boys ate with gusto, That clown is speaking nonsense, Father speaks with such fortitude.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.12 TFM The Transformative Case <p>The TRANSFORMATIVE case is marked by    the Vc value -oa-. The TRANSFORMATIVE identifies the outcome    or final state of a process, often translatable by \u2018to,\u2019 \u2018until,\u2019    or \u2018into\u2019 in the sense of reaching a final state after having undergone    some transformation. Example usages would be The house burned to      ashes, The clown reached a state of tranquility, The      clowns will turn our children into slaves, Her father drank      himself to death.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.13 REF The Referential Case <p>The REFERENTIAL case is marked by the Vc value -oe-. The REFERENTIAL identifies a noun functioning    as the general referent of the verb, translating such English terms as \u2018about,\u2019    \u2018regarding,\u2019 \u2018concerning,\u2019 \u2018in regard to,\u2019    \u2018in reference to,\u2019 \u2018pertaining to,\u2019 or \u2018as for.\u2019    Examples of use would be a song of love; As for      those books, burn them!; Let\u2019s talk about clowns;      His attitude toward women.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.14 CLA The Classificative Case <p>The CLASSIFICATIVE case is marked by    the Vc value -\u00f6a-. The CLASSIFICATIVE identifies a noun    as a basis for arranging, sorting, classifying, or counting, translating various    English prepositions and phrases used for this purpose. Example of usage are Place them in groups of three, The workers arranged the      tables in rows, He lay down lengthwise, Can      you count by fives?, I will sort them by color.</p> <p>The CLASSIFICATIVE is also used to identify    a noun considered in consecutively recurring increments as a means of describing    the manner of an event. This is usually in conjunction with nouns denoting time    periods, but can be used with any concrete noun to describe the repetitive nature    of an event. Examples would be Month by month, their departure      crept closer; Year after year, I see more and more clowns; Day in, day out, he\u2019s always working;      The fertilizer factory keeps rolling them out, bag upon bag; Patient by patient, the nurse administered injections.</p> <p>Note that the CLASSIFICATIVE would not    be used to describe a noun other than adverbially, e.g., it would not be used    to translate the sentence One bomb after another fell on the city.    Such a construction would utilize a suffix indicating sequential instantiations    of the noun (see Sec.      7.4.4).</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.15 CNV The Conductive Case <p>The CONDUCTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00f6e-. The CONDUCTIVE identifies the meaningful    or relevant context of another. It can be thought of as conveying the relationship    signified by the expressions \u2018having to do with,\u2019 \u2018as it pertains    to,\u2019 or \u2018considered within the context of.\u2019 Examples of English    phrases translatable using this case are a circus clown,      a mountain man, a feeling of loneliness, the Mafia\u2019s world, a realm of fear, my life achievement, childhood memories, Let\u2019s      discuss the morality of war. </p> 4.5.16 IDP The Interdependent Case <p>The INTERDEPENDENT case is marked by    the Vc value -\u00fca- unless the preceding Cr stems ending in -w or -y, in which case the Vc value is -i\u2019-. The INTERDEPENDENT identifies a noun    which has a coordinated, tandem, complementary or mutually dependent relationship    with another. The relationship between the two nouns can be thought of as reciprocal    in nature, i.e., each noun implies the other or needs the other to exist within    it\u2019s natural context, e.g., the students\u2019 teacher,      an army general, the blood in my veins, the      driver of the truck, the nation\u2019s leader, his team (i.e., the one on which he\u2019s a member). Note that this case    does not imply a part-whole dependency as with the GENITIVE case above, e.g., it would not be used to translate the book\u2019s pages,    or the leaves of a tree.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.17 BEN The Benefactive Case <p>The BENEFACTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00fce- unless the preceding Cr stems ending in -w or -y, in which case the Vc value is -\u00f6\u2019-. The BENEFACTIVE identifies a noun for    whose sake or benefit an action or event occurs or is done. As such, the BENEFACTIVE is similar to the DATIVE, except that the BENEFACTIVE implies a strong emphasis on the fact that the noun is more than simply the    recipient or target of a dative action, but rather benefits in a tangible or    consequential way from the action or event. It is usually translated by English    \u2018for\u2019 in the sense of \u2018for the sake (i.e., benefit) of.\u2019    Examples of usage are a toy for the children, We threw him a party, Go to the teachers\u2019      lounge.</p> <p>The BENEFACTIVE also translates the English    phrases \u2018out of respect for,\u2019 \u2018for the sake of,\u2019 or    \u2018in deference toward,\u2019 identifying the noun to which deference is    paid within the context for an act, condition, or event. Examples of usage would    be He remained silent for her sake, They went on with the  ceremony out of respect for the families, They dressed in robes because of tradition.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.18 TSP The Transpositive Case <p>The TRANSPOSITIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00fco- unless  the preceding Cr stem ends in -w, in which case the Vc value is -\u00ee\u2019-, or the preceding Cr stem ends in-y, in which case the Vc value is -\u00fb\u2019. The TRANSPOSITIVE implies substitution    of one noun for another. It translates English \u2018for\u2019 in the sense    of \u2018on behalf of,\u2019 \u2018in place of,\u2019 or \u2018instead    of\u2019 (i.e., \u2018as a substitution for\u2019). Examples of usage are The boss made the speech for me, She went up into the attic for her brother (i.e., so he wouldn\u2019t have to).</p> <p> </p> 4.5.19 CMM The Commutative Case <p>The COMMUTATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -au-. The COMMUTATIVE translates English    \u2018for\u2019 in the sense of \u2018in exchange for\u2019 as in You      paid too much money for that dress, She kills for thrills.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.20 COM The Comitative Case <p>The COMITATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -eu-. Similar to its counterpart in Uralic languages such as Finnish    or Estonian, the COMITATIVE translates the English \u2018with\u2019    in its meaning of accompaniment (i.e., \u2018along with\u2019) as in The      child went with the clown to the party. Like English \u2018with,\u2019    the COMITATIVE does not imply that the conjoined noun    is necessarily engaged in the same activity or associated with the same verb    as the head noun. For example, in the sentence My father was walking with      a loaf of bread, the loaf of bread is not considered to be itself walking. </p> <p>It should be noted, however, that the COMITATIVE is not used to imply mutually interactive or reciprocal activity between two    nouns. Thus it would not be used in translating the sentences They danced      with each other or Mother wants to talk with you. These would    be translated using the RECIPROCAL valence of the verb,    explained in Section 5.7.    This distinction is illustrated even more clearly by comparing the following    two sentences; the first would be translated using the COMITATIVE,    the second would not: This man fought with my father (e.g., alongside    him during the war) versus This man fought with my father (e.g., they    had a fight with each other).</p> <p>Note also that the COMITATIVE is not    used to indicate instrumentality (English \u2018with\u2019 meaning \u2018by    means of\u2019). Thus, it is not used to translate sentences such as I      cut the meat with a knife. As previously discussed in Section        4.3.8, instrumentality is indicated by use of the INSTRUMENTAL case. Likewise, it is not used to identify the resources or material(s) consumed    in undertaking an act, as in He catches his fish with worms for which the COMPOSITIVE case is used. </p> <p> </p> 4.5.21 CNJ The Conjunctive Case <p>The CONJUNCTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -iu-. The CONJUNCTIVE translates English    \u2018with\u2019 in its meaning of \u2018in conjunction with,\u2019 i.e.,    to indicate that the noun is engaged in the same activity or a complementary    activity as the conjoined noun. It should be distinguished from the COMITATIVE above, which indicates mere accompaniment. For example, in the walking with      a loaf of bread example from above, it would be incorrect to use the CONJUNCTIVE case because that would signify the bread was walking, too. To further illustrate    the usage, consider the sentence I\u2019m with the brigade. Translating    \u2018brigade\u2019 using the COMITATIVE would mean    that \u2018I\u2019ve come along (e.g., drove) with the brigade to the scene,\u2019    while using the CONJUNCTIVE would mean \u2018I\u2019m    a member of the brigade.\u2019 Additional examples where the CONJUNCTIVE would be used are They skate with the best team, That teacher works well      with children.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.22 UTL The Utilitative Case <p>The UTILITATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ou-. The UTILITATIVE identifies a noun in    the process of being utilized. This corresponds to the use of English \u2018with\u2019    where it refers to actual use in progress as in A man with a gun ran into the room. It should be distinguished from the INSTRUMENTAL (see Sec. 4.3.8) in that the latter indicates the implement    used to accomplish an action, while the UTILITATIVE identifies    a noun in use, but does not imply that the noun was the implement used to accomplish    a stated action. For example, compare the sentence The man with      an umbrella was pushing a stroller in the rain (UTILITATIVE)    with The man pushed a stroller in the rain with an umbrella (INSTRUMENTAL). The first sentence implies the man was    pushing a stroller with one hand while holding an open umbrella against the    rain, whereas the second sentence has him using the umbrella to push the stroller.    Another way to translate the UTILITATIVE would be to use    an English gerundial construction as in A gun-wielding man ran into the room or An umbrella-toting man pushed      a stroller in the rain.</p> <p>Besides the INSTRUMENTAL, the UTILITATIVE should likewise be distinguished from the COMITATIVE case    above, in that the COMITATIVE merely indicates accompaniment,    while the UTILITATIVE indicates use in progress. For example,    the sentence Go sit next to the girl with the book,    if translated using the COMITATIVE would merely identify    a girl who has a book in her visible possession, while with the UTILITATIVE it would mean the girl is actually engaged in reading the book.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.23 ABE The Abessive Case <p>The ABESSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00ebu-. The ABESSIVE is essentially the opposite    of the COMITATIVE, translating the English \u2018without\u2019    or \u2018-less\u2019 in the sense of \u2018unaccompanied by\u2019 or \u2018not    having\u2019 as in a day without rain or a treeless plain. As noted in the next section below on the CONVERSIVE case, it is not used to translate \u2018without\u2019 when    it means \u2018unless one has,\u2019 referring to a hypothetical exception    to a potential outcome as in I can\u2019t go on without love.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.24 CVS The Conversive Case <p>The CONVERSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00f6u-. The CONVERSIVE is used in conjunction    with hypothetical or potential contexts to identify a hypothetical exception    to a potential outcome or an actual circumstance which alters or has altered    a potential outcome. This translates two different ways into English. Where    it indicates an exception to a hypothetical situation, it is translated by the    conjunction \u2018unless\u2019 in verbal contexts, and by the preposition    \u2018without\u2019 for nouns (note that \u2018without\u2019 in this sense    does not correspond to its usual ABESSIVE usage in Sec.    4.5.23 above). If applied to a real or actual situation, it is translatable by    such expressions as \u2018but for,\u2019 \u2018if not for,\u2019 \u2018if    it wasn\u2019t for,\u2019 or \u2018if it wasn\u2019t on account of.\u2019    Example of usage: Without peace, this society is doomed; If not for the rain, we would have had a good time.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.25 COR The Correlative Case <p>The CORRELATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ai\u2019-. The CORRELATIVE is used to indicate    an abstract relationship, association, or conjunction between a noun and another    noun or verb, including  subjective, contextual, metaphorical, or symbolic associations. It translates general phrases such as \u2018relative to,\u2019    \u2018in relation to,\u2019 \u2018in correlation with,\u2019 \u2018in association    with,\u2019 etc. It would be used in translating phrases such as career goals, the soup of the day, the direction of that road,      The elapsed time relative to the distance determines the winner,      Our next topic is sex and (or in) art (i.e., the relationship between art and sex). Additional examples are years of wonder,        the Clown Planet, life blood, city of          evil. Note that the CORRELATIVE case would often be used to translate constructions for which English often    uses an adjective, e.g., spatial coordinates, the political economy, a dangerous situation (i.e., a situation    characterized by danger).</p> <p>When used in contexts involving directional motion or spatial positioning,    the CORRELATIVE signifies the directional orientation or position of one    noun relative to another, i.e., a noun relative      to whose position in space another noun is being described for purposes of spatial      orientation. To an English-speaker, the function of this case makes greater      sense once one realizes that, in Ithkuil, most one-to-one spatial relationships      are described by verbs, not prepositions, e.g., \u2018to be situated on the      right,\u2019 \u2018to move beneath,\u2019 etc. Consequently, this use of the CORRELATIVE case can be thought of as expressing the phrase \u2018relative to.\u2019 Examples      of how it would be used are I\u2019m standing four feet north of        the desk, The one hanging above the boxes looks fresh,        It lies at a 30\u00b0 angle relative to the tree, He turned his back on me,          The upstairs bedroom faces the yard, It\u2019s alongside the            desk (i.e., its lateral surface is oriented toward the desk).</p> <p>As will be described in Section 5.4.2.3, the CORRELATIVE is used with verbal case-frames to convey the equivalent of simple relative clauses in Western languages. </p> <p> </p> 4.5.26 DEP The Dependent Case <p>The DEPENDENT case is marked by the Vc value -ui\u2019-. The DEPENDENT translates the English    phrase \u2018depending on\u2019 signifying a noun as the contingency on which    the reality of a main clause depends. Examples of usage would be Depending      on the rain, we\u2019ll go for a picnic; She may show up, depending        on her attitude.</p> <p>The DEPENDENT should be distinguished    from the PREDICATIVE case in Sec.      4.5.4, in that the former denotes contingency, while the PREDICATIVE denotes reliance. </p> <p> </p> 4.5.27 PVS The Provisional Case <p>The PROVISIONAL case is marked by the Vc value -ei\u2019-. The PROVISIONAL identifies the noun, situation, or circumstance on which    the factuality of the main clause of the sentence depends, i.e., the required    condition(s) which must come into existence for the situation described in the    main clause to occur. This is translatable by such English phrases as \u2018provided    (that),\u2019 \u2018on condition of,\u2019 \u2018only in case of,\u2019    or \u2018but only if,\u2019 e.g., Provided [there\u2019s] food,      I will attend the meeting; We will fight only in case of war.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.28 PTL The Postulative Case <p>The POSTULATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -oi\u2019-. The operates somewhat similarly to the PROVISIONAL above, except that the POSTULATIVE implies a causal or    consequential relationship (not merely a circumstantial one) between the pre-condition(s)    and the circumstances of the main clause. Specifically, it identifies the noun,    situation, or circumstance whose factuality has not yet come into existence,    but, should it come into existence, will result in the consequence indicated    by the main clause. This is translatable by English \u2018if,\u2019 or \u2018in    case of.\u2019 Note that it does not translate English \u2018if\u2019 where    it means \u2018whether\u2019 as in I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s warm      enough, i.e., where the clause is meant only to convey uncertainty or optionality    (but not a causal relationship between a potential condition and its consequences).    Examples of usage: If [there\u2019s] snow, I\u2019m not      going out; In case of fire, flee; If friend,      welcome them, if foe, kill \u2019em.</p> <p> The example below is offered to further distinguish the use of the POSTULATIVE case    from the PROVISIONAL case above:</p> <p>PROVISIONAL: We\u2019re packing    umbrellas, but only in case of bad weather (i.e., umbrellas    will not be packed unless the weather is actually bad).      POSTULATIVE: We\u2019re packing umbrellas in        case of bad weather (i.e., the umbrellas are being packed in preparation  for the possibility of bad weather).</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.5.29 CON The Concessive Case <p>The CONCESSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -au\u2019-. The CONCESSIVE case identifies a noun,    situation, or circumstance which gives rise to an expectation of a certain result    which, in fact, does not occur. This can be translated by various English prepositions,    conjunctions, or phrases such as \u2018despite,\u2019 \u2018in spite of,\u2019    \u2018notwithstanding,\u2019 \u2018although,\u2019 \u2018regardless of,\u2019    \u2018no matter what,\u2019 etc. Examples of usage: In spite of      his stupidity, he passed the test; The law notwithstanding,      I will stand my ground; No matter how ignorant (they may be),      they are welcome, Although foreigners, we will let them attend      the meeting.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.30 EXC The Exceptive Case <p>The EXCEPTIVE case is marked by the Vc value -iu\u2019-. The EXCEPTIVE indicates a noun, situation,    or circumstance which is an exception, or is exempted or excluded from the main    clause, translatable by English \u2018except (for),\u2019 \u2018but (not),\u2019    or \u2018excluding.\u2019 Examples of usage: She loves everybody except      clowns; I like all animals, excluding dogs; He eats      almost anything but (not) spinach.</p> <p> </p> 4.5.31 AVR The Aversive Case <p>The AVERSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -eu\u2019-. The AVERSIVE identifies a noun as a    source or object of fear and/or avoidance. With nouns, it translates expressions    such as \u2018for fear of,\u2019 \u2018in order to avoid,\u2019 or \u2018in    avoidance of.\u2019 With verb phrases (i.e., case-frames; see Sec.      5.2) , it would translate English \u2018lest.\u2019 Examples of usage    are She finished her plate for fear of my wrath, I traveled      by night to avoid the sun.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.32 CMP The Comparative Case <p>The COMPARATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ou\u2019-. The COMPARATIVE identifies a noun being    compared to another. It translates such expressions as \u2018as    compared to,\u2019 or certain usages of \u2018versus\u2019 or  \u2018as opposed to.\u2019 It is similar to the CONTRASTIVE case (see Section 4.5.2 above), except that it does not carry the sense of opposition,  joint exclusivity, or either-or binary substitution of the CONTRASTIVE, but rather merely comparison/choice/preference from various options or along a spectrum or scale. With verbal case-frames (see Sec. 5.4) it would translate as    \u2018whereas\u2019 or \u2018while\u2019 (in its synonymous usage to \u2018whereas\u2019).    Examples are She chose the red one as opposed to the others,      Sam drives a van versus Joe, who prefers a truck, You\u2019ll find it in Room Twelve [as opposed to a room with a different number].</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.5.33 Examples of Associative Cases in Use  <p> \u00e2kyu\u00e1l \u00a0vlal\u00eax STA-\u2018coffee.bean.drink\u2019-PAR-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-FML\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STA-\u2018contain.via.gravity/basin\u2019-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-SIZ<sub>2</sub>/3-IFL \u2018cup of coffee\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p> \u00e2kniel  STA-\u2018pet.snake\u2019-CRS-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018as opposed to the pet snake / rather than the pet snake\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p> u\u00e7t\u00e1l \u00a0op<sup>h</sup>iol STA-\u2018wall.of.room\u2019-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-FML\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STA-\u2018wood\u2019-CPS-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL \u2018wooden wall\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p> t<sup>h</sup>arl \u00a0ri\u00f6\u010d STA-\u2018law/statute\u2019-OBL-NRM/DEL/M/ASO/AGG-IFL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STA-\u2018reason\u2019-PRD-NRM/DEL/A/ASO/UNI-IFL \u2018laws based in reason\u2019 LISTEN </p> <p> Op\u00e7av\u00a0  \u00f6kcul\u00a0 \u00f6dh\u00e1\u2019\u0161k.

In    many respects, Ithkuil analyzes time similarly to Western languages, particularly    in the ability to spatially compartmentalize time as seen in such English phrases    as \u2018in 3 hours,\u2019 \u2018for 5 years,\u2019 \u2018day by day,\u2019    and \u2018per month,\u2019 as well as in analyzing time as progressively linear    using concepts such as \u2018before,\u2019 \u2018after,\u2019 \u2018during,\u2019    \u2018until,\u2019 and \u2018ago.\u2019 The fifteen temporal cases are the SIMULTANEITIVE,      ASSESSIVE, CONCURSIVE, ACCESSIVE, DIFFUSIVE, PERIODIC, PROLAPSIVE, PRECURSIVE,      POSTCURSIVE, ELAPSIVE, ALLAPSIVE, INTERPOLATIVE, EPISODIC, PROLIMITIVE, and LIMITATIVE. Following are explanations    of the function and usage of each case. Actual Ithkuil examples of these cases    in use are provided in Sec. 4.6.16.</p> <p> </p> 4.6.1 SML The Simultaneitive Case <p>The SIMULTANEITIVE case is marked by    the Vc value -a\u2019a-, or optionally -a\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The SIMULTANEITIVE identifies a noun    signifying a time period simultaneous to the act, state, or event under discussion.    Examples would be I was in class at the same time as his accident,      I worked a side-job concurrent to the strike, She laughed simultaneously        with my coughing fit.</p> <p> </p> 4.6.2 ASS The Assessive Case <p>The ASSESSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -e\u2019a-, or optionally -e\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The ASSESSIVE specifies the unit of    time by which a contextual ratio of measurement is created, corresponding to    English \u2018by\u2019 or \u2018per.\u2019 Examples would be My lawyer      charges by the minute, He publishes several books each        year, The clown drove the fun-mobile at 90 miles per hour.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.6.3 CNR The Concursive Case <p>The CONCURSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -i\u2019a-, or optionally -i\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The CONCURSIVE serves as a \u201ctemporal    locative\u201d signifying the beginning and ending boundaries of time during    or at which an act, state, or event occurs, the whole of which being considered    a single contextual situation. Examples of usage would be He prays during      lunch, She studied hard last night, I won\u2019t      visit until then (i.e., during that period in time). </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.4 ACS The Accessive Case <p>The ACCESSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -o\u2019a-, or optionally -o\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The ACCESSIVE is similar to the CONCURSIVE, except    that the time identified is specific to a single moment or a brief, highly delimited    period seen in context as one moment, i.e., the point in time at which something    occurs. Examples of usage would be Dinner will be served at sunset; When (i.e., at the moment that) you hear his voice,      call in the clowns; Upon impact, both cars were accelerating.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> 4.6.5 DFF The Diffusive Case <p>The DIFFUSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -u\u2019a-, or optionally -u\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The DIFFUSIVE is yet another temporal    locative similar to the CONCURSIVE, except that the time    period identified does not have explicit boundaries, only being centered on    the period identified by the noun. It is best expressed by the English phrase    \u2018during the time surrounding\u2026.\u2019 Examples of usage would be Most cars had tail fins in those days; I was abroad during      that era; At the time of his death, the number of      clowns was increasing; Over the past several seasons, your      talent has matured.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.6 PER The Periodic Case <p>The PERIODIC case is marked by the Vc value -\u00f6\u2019a-, or optionally -\u00f6\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The PERIODIC identifies the span of    time at some point(s) during which, an act, condition, or event occurs. This    case should be distinguished from the CONCURSIVE above,    in that the CONCURSIVE signifies    a contextually single holistic event, whereas the PERIODIC specifies a time frame in which separate events, repetitions,    or durationally extended acts or states take place. Examples would be He wrote the novel in six months, These clowns can corrupt your child within      a few days, The woman has been ill a lot this year, For the last several concerts, my voice has been deteriorating.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.7 PRO The Prolapsive Case <p>The PROLAPSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00fc\u2019a- (or -\u00ebu\u2019a- if the preceding Cr stem ends in -w or -y). Optionally the Vc value can be -\u00fc\u2019V- (or -\u00ebu\u2019V- if the preceding Cr stem ends in -w or -y), where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The PROLAPSIVE signifies the duration    of an act, condition, or event, i.e., how long it takes or lasts. This case    should be distinguished from the PERIODIC above, in that    the PROLAPSIVE specifies the actual duration of the act,    condition, or event, whereas the PERIODIC merely specifies    a contextual span of time at some point(s) during which, an act, condition,    or event occurs. Examples would be He prayed through lunch, While he was dying, the number of clowns increased, It rained all night, It took three days for the fever      to break, She sang for an hour.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.8 PCV The Precursive Case <p>The PRECURSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ai\u2019a-, or optionally -ai\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p> The PRECURSIVE identifies a point in    time prior to which an act, condition, or event occurs.

Examples would be This      situation occurred after the war, It rained subsequent        to his appearance, There will be a presentation following the          banquet.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.10 ELP The Elapsive Case <p>The ELAPSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ui\u2019a-, or optionally -ui\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The ELAPSIVE identifies the amount    of time that has passed between the contextual present and the time of the act,    condition, or event being spoken of. It corresponds to English \u2018\u2026ago.\u2019    Examples would be Four years ago I was a student; Going      back three generations, women could not even vote.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.11 ALP The Allapsive Case <p>The ALLAPSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -oi\u2019a-, or optionally -oi\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The ALLAPSIVE identifies the amount    of time that expected to pass between the contextual present and the time of    a future act, condition, or event. Examples would be Four years      from now, I will be a student; Looking ahead three generations,      clowns will rule the world; I will be home in three days; Little      did he know that two months later he\u2019d be a rich man.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.12 INP The Interpolative Case <p>The INTERPOLATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00ebi\u2019a-, or optionally -\u00ebi\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The INTERPOLATIVE is used within the    context of repetitive or iterative acts, states, and events and signifies the    duration of each repetition. Examples of usage are We heard several five-second snippets of music; Between lightning bursts were intervals of several      seconds; She gets recurring migraines, each lasting hours.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.13 EPS The Episodic Case <p>The EPISODIC case is marked by the Vc value -au\u2019a-, or optionally -au\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The EPISODIC identifies a contextually    recurring time-period. Examples of usage are The man talks with his mother every three days; Each year, I travel to the      Clown Planet; He works nights; By day, she      is an artisan; The clowns visit us on Sundays.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.14 PLM The Prolimitive Case <p>The PROLIMITIVE case is marked by the Vc value -eu\u2019a-, or optionally -eu\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The PROLIMITIVE defines a point in    time which signifies a temporal limit to further contextual activity, i.e.,    the time by which some act, state, or event occurs. Examples of usage would    be By the time of your graduation, I want you out of the      house; Please be on board by midnight; By the time        of the raid, there was nothing left to steal.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.6.15 LIM The Limitative Case <p>The LIMITATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -iu\u2019a-, or optionally -iu\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The LIMITATIVE signifies a event culminating    an anticipatory context.

While various non-Indo-European languages such as Finnish, Hungarian, Basque    and the North Caucasian languages accomplish the equivalent of prepositional    relationships using noun cases, such relationships are usually accomplished    in Ithkuil via verbal formatives (e.g., a verb translatable as \u2018to be    inside of\u2019 instead of a preposition \u2018inside of\u2019). Nevertheless,    there are six cases corresponding to certain types of  spatial relationships.    These are the LOCATIVE, ORIENTATIVE, PROCURSIVE, ALLATIVE, ABLATIVE,    and NAVIGATIVE. </p> <p>Also: see Section 4.5.25 above regarding the use of the CORRELATIVE case in sentences involving spatial direction or orientation. </p> <p>Following are explanations of the function    and usage of each case. Actual Ithkuil examples of these cases in use are provided    in Sec. 4.7.7.</p> <p> </p> 4.7.1 LOC The Locative Case <p>The LOCATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00e2\u2019a-, or optionally -\u00e2\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The LOCATIVE signifies general static    position in the same contextual place as the specified location, translatable    by many English prepositions such as \u2018at,\u2019 \u2018in,\u2019 \u2018on,\u2019    or \u2018by,\u2019 depending on the context, e.g., in that building, by      the wall, on the street, at my house. </p> 4.7.2 ORI The Orientative Case <p>The ORIENTATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00ea\u2019a-, or optionally -\u00ea\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The ORIENTATIVE identifies the noun    (usually a subcomponent or body part) which serves as the forward \u201cend\u201d    of a spatially orientated axis aligned to a vector of motion. This is translatable    into English using elements such as \u2018-ward(s)\u2019 or \u2018-first\u2019    in conjunction with portions of objects in a spatio-orientational context, e.g., He jumped in feet-first, The car rolled backward.    The ORIENTATIVE allows for the extension of this concept    to contexts which seem awkward in English translation, e.g., He walked \u201cbutt-ward\u201d      down the street (i.e., backward with his butt protruding frontwards, leading    the way).</p> <p> </p> 4.7.3 PSV The Procursive Case <p>The PROCURSIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00f4\u2019a-, or optionally -\u00f4\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The PROCURSIVE identifies a noun (often    a subcomponent or body part) which serves as the orientational reference point,    interactional surface or interface relative to the direction of interaction    with, or position in space of, a second noun. This second noun usually appears    in  the ALLATIVE case (see below). Examples of use would be They      collided sideways, She turned her back on      him, The chair \u201cfaced\u201d the doorway (i.e.,    The chair stood with it\u2019s seat and back aligned toward the doorway).</p> <p> </p> 4.7.4 ALL The Allative Case <p>The ALLATIVE case is marked by either the Vc value -\u00ee\u2019a- or -\u00fb\u2019a-; if the preceding Cr stem ends in -w, the Vc value is -\u00ee\u2019V-, whereas if the preceding Cr stem ends in -y, the Vc value is -\u00fb\u2019V-; for other Cr stems, either Vc value is permissible. Optionally the Vc value can be -\u00ee\u2019V- or -\u00fb\u2019V- (under the same rules for Cr stems ending in -w or -y), where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>When used in the context of explicit or implied directional    motion, the ALLATIVE signifies the direction of motion,    translatable by \u2018to\u2019 or \u2018toward(s)\u2019 or the suffix \u2018-ward(s)\u2019    in English. Note that the ALLATIVE in no way implies that    the object is intended as the final or intended destination or goal of the motion    or movement, only the direction of the movement. Examples would be I wandered eastward, The little girl ran toward me, Throw      the rock at that clown!, We headed for home.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.7.5 ABL The Ablative Case <p>The ABLATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00ebu\u2019a-, or optionally -\u00ebu\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if both phonotactically and morpho-phonologically permissible (i.e., if it\u2019s deletion does not violate phonotactic rules (see Section 1.4) and does not cause confusion or ambiguity in parsing the various consonants and vowels of the formative into their respective morphemes (i.e., their grammatical components). </p> <p>When used in context of explicit or implied directional motion,    the ABLATIVE signifies the general directional origin    of movement away from or out of. It does not specify the actual point of origin    or departure. Examples would be He came out of the east,      She walked here from (the direction of) the river.</p> <p>When used in contexts where directional motion is not implied,    the ABLATIVE signifies a reverse directional orientation    of one noun relative to another, e.g., He faced away from me.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 4.7.6 NAV The Navigative Case <p>The NAVIGATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -ou\u2019a-, or optionally -ou\u2019V-, where V has the value of the formative\u2019s Vr affix (from Slot IV); if choosing the latter value for Vc, then the formative\u2019s Vr affix can be deleted from Slot IV if it is in word-initial position. </p> <p>The NAVIGATIVE identifies the noun    relative to whose vector, arc, or trajectory of motion an act, state, or event    takes place. This is particularly important, as we will see in Section      10.3.3  that Ithkuil modes of positional reference are tied into the vectors    of movement or the configurational axes of objects in the environment such as    the sun or the length of a room. Example uses would be I looked down      the street, We aligned it perpendicular to the path of the        sun, He crossed the room diagonally (i.e., walked    diagonally relative to the long axis of the room.)</p>    4.7.7 Examples of Spatial Cases in Use <p> \u00dbb \u00a0eikkradwa \u00a0smou\u2019ol\u00e2xh.

LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 4.8 THE VOCATIVE <p>The VOCATIVE case is marked by the Vc value -\u00eb-. The VOCATIVE is used when a nominal formative is used in direct address. In modern colloquial English, there is no vocative form, and the base form of the noun, name, or pronoun is used, usually followed by an exclamation point if the vocative functions as its own sentence, e.g., \u2018Bill!\u2019 or  \u2018Please come this way, sir\u2019 or  \u2018Driver, take me to 53rd and 3rd.\u2019 However, in archaic, poetic, formal or dramatic contexts, English utilizes the vocative particle \"o\", as in \u2018O Time, thy pyramids!\u2019 or \u2018Why me, o lord?\u2019</p>"},{"location":"5/","title":"5 Verbs","text":"A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 5: Verb Morphology <p>   The Ithkuil verbal formative (termed \u201cverb\u201d in    this chapter for simplicity\u2019s sake) is the workhorse of the language,    inflecting for twenty-two different morphological categories. These include    the seven categories shared by all formatives and already discussed in Chapter      3: Configuration, Affiliation, Perspective, Extension, Essence,        Context, and Designation. Additionally the following    fifteen categories apply solely to verbs: Function, Mood, Illocution, Case-Frame, Relation, Phase,      Sanction, Valence, Version, Validation, Aspect, Format, Modality, Level, and Bias. Additionally, Ithkuil allows for stem incorporation, i.e., for one formative stem to be incorporated inside of another  to expand the latter\u2019s semantic range. The verb can also    theoretically take any number of the approximately 1800 suffixes available to formatives.    Such suffixes are analyzed in Chapter      7. </p> <p>The full structure of a Ithkuil verbal formative is in two parts,    i.e., having two distinct words, these being a valence/modality adjunct    and the verb itself. In simple sentences, the valence/modality adjunct may be missing. The following extreme example of a fully inflected    Ithkuil verb illustrates all  22 of the above-listed categories, as well as demonstrating an incorporated stem:</p> <p> </p> hru\u0161trul-ly\u00f6\u2019\u0148 \u00a0\u02c9hni\u010d<sup>h</sup>\u00e2\u00e7t\u00e0u\u2019watkw\u00f6u\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b <p>hr.u.\u0161tr.u.l-ly.\u00f6.\u2019\u0148 </p> Valence:  DEMONSTRATIVE  Level: SURPASSIVE-RELATIVE  Phase: RECURRENT Sanction: REFUTATIVE Illocution: DIRECTIVE Modality: DESIDERATIVE Aspect 1: REGRESSIVE  Apect 2: IMMINENT Bias: COINCIDENTAL  <p>\u02c9.hn.i.\u010d<sup>h</sup>.\u00e2.\u00e7t.\u00e0u.\u2019wa.tkw.\u00f6u </p> <p>Validation:  PRESUMPTIVE 2          Function: DYNAMIC         Pattern/Stem of Main Root:\u00a0 Pattern 1, Stem 1         Incorporated Root: \u010d<sup>h</sup> \u2018make/construct\u2019  Pattern/Stem of Inc.

The remaining  categories specific  to valence/modality adjuncts (Modality, Level, and Bias) will be described in Chapter    6.  Additionally, the category of  Format, while displayed within the formative, is closely tied to the phenomenon of stem incorporation, which is also discussed in Chapter 6.  Therefore, Format will  be discussed  in that chapter. </p> <p> </p> 5.1 FUNCTION  <p>Function refers to the general relationship a verb has to its noun participants based on whether the verb represents an existential or psychological state, a dynamic action or event, a mere statement of X = Y identification, or a description. Without    a standardized system for the lexico-semantic function of verbs, the meaning of such a form could only be    learned from hearing others using it in context.</p> <p>Note that, although Function is being described here in the chapter on Verbs, Ithkuil nouns, too,   carry a Function, specifically the STATIVE function, in that they manifest an inherent, existential (i.e., non-dynamic) state of matter/energy. Because  a formative\u2019s Function changes only for verbs, not nouns, Function is being discussed in this chapter.</p> <p>As previously described in Section 2.2.2, Function is shown by the Vr affix in Slot IV, which also conveys the main root\u2019s Stem and Pattern. </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction     (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation OR Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction     (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

Note that the choice of whether a particular situation is to be considered STATIVE or DYNAMIC can be subjective. For example, if a person is chronically coughing due to an illness, one can describe the coughing using either the DYNAMIC (to focus for example on the  paroxysmal movements and physical processes undergone by the person during each cough), or the STATIVE (to let the reader/listener know you consider the coughing to be merely a manifestation of an existential state, e.g., an illness, in which the physical motions and processes associated with each cough are not the relevant issue. </p> <p>In the examples  from Section 4.3.12 involving anger-inducing clowns and burning trees, we likewise saw the difference in meaning between using STATIVE versus DYNAMIC function for otherwise identical sentences.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 5.1.3 MNF The Manifestive <p>MANIFESTIVE function  indicates that the verb represents a manifestion or naming of the identity of a specific entity; this is the nearest equivalent to the X=Y \u201cbe\u201d    copula of identification in Western languages, as in She is  a manager, That man is secretly a clown, Dogs are mammals, Mrs. Beasly is a fat  crone.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 5.1.4 DSC The Descriptive <p>DESCRIPTIVE function  indicates descriptive manifestation,    i.e., to appear or manifest in the manner of.

LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 5.2 MOOD <p>Most languages have a morphological category for verbs known    as \u201cmood,\u201d serving to indicate specific attitudes or perspectives    on the act, condition, or event, or the degree of factuality involved. Example    moods common to Western languages include the indicative (factual utterances),    subjunctive (showing doubt or probability, expressed by \u2018may/might\u2019    in English), imperative (indicating commands, e.g., Go now!, Sing it for      us! ), conditional (expressing hypotheticals, e.g., She would travel        if she could), optative (indicating wishes, hopes, expectations, e.g., I wish he\u2019d go, I expect him to be here), and hortative (indicating    exhortations, e.g., May he live 100 years! Let them see for themselves!).</p> <p>We will see later in Section 5.3       that in Ithkuil the functions of certain moods in Western languages    correspond not to Mood, but to the grammatical category of Illocution, specifically    where Western moods function to describe types of speech acts. In Ithkuil, moods    simply convey a two-fold distinction as to whether the factuality of an utterance    is certain or uncertain, combined with a four-way distinction as to whether    the factuality of an explicit or implicit assumption underlying the utterance    (i.e., a presupposition) is true, false, unknown, or a determinant of the factuality    of the utterance. This twofold by fourfold matrix renders a total of eight moods in Ithkuil.</p> <p>The eight moods are FACTUAL, SUBJUNCTIVE, ASSUMPTIVE,    SPECULATIVE, COUNTERFACTIVE, HYPOTHETICAL, IMPLICATIVE, and ASCRIPTIVE.  They are shown in conjunction with the morphological category of Illocution (see Section 5.3) by the Ci+Vi infix placed in Slot IX. The Ci+Vi infix is of the form consonant Ci followed by a vowel Vi. </p> <p>(NOTE: Under certain  circumstances, as an alternate to the Ci+Vi infix in Slot IX, Mood can  be shown via the Cs prefix in Slot III usually used to show the category of Aspect. These circumstances are described later in Section 5.10 on Aspect.) </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction     (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR     Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction     (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

Thus, adding the Ci+Vi infix -wa- to the formative daus results in dahwas, not dauwas.</p> <p>Also, if the formative\u2019s Vc case affix is a diphthong ending in -i (i.e., ai, ei, oi, ui, \u00f6i, \u00ebi), the  -y-value of Ci changes from  to -hw- (while the Vc diphthong is left intact). Thus, adding the Ci+Vi infix -ya- to the formative dais results in daihwas, not daiyas.</p> <p>Table 9 below shows the values of the Ci+Vi infix by Illocution and Mood. </p> <p> Table 9: Ci + Vi infix values  indicating 6 Illocutions x 8 Moods </p> MOOD ILLOCUTION            (see Sec. 5.3)                     \u2193      FAC     SUB     ASM     SPC     COU     HYP     IPL     ASC 1 ASSERTIVE (-w\u00eb)* -wa -y\u00eb -ya -y\u00fb -h\u00eb -ha -h\u00fb / -h\u00ee 2 DIRECTIVE  -we -w\u00f6 -ye -y\u00f6 -yeu / -wei -he -h\u00f6 -hei 3 INTERROGATIVE  -wu -w\u00e2 -yu -y\u00e2 -yau / -wai -hu -h\u00e2 -hai 4 ADMONITIVE  -wo -w\u00ea -yo -y\u00ea -you / -woi -ho -h\u00ea -hoi 5 HORTATIVE -wi -w\u00f4 -yi -y\u00f4 -yiu / -wui -hi -h\u00f4 -hui 6 DECLARATIVE ** -w\u00ee \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 * The combination of FACTUAL Mood + ASSERTIVE Illocution is usually unmarked.

As was seen above in Section 5.1, Mood functions in a much narrower grammatical range than in Western languages.    When the moods of Western language actually relate to types of speech acts,    the equivalent function in Ithkuil is shown by the category of Illocution.</p> <p>There are six illocutions in Ithkuil: ASSERTIVE, INTERROGATIVE, DIRECTIVE, ADMONITIVE, HORTATIVE and DECLARATIVE.    They distinguish the type of speech act being performed by the speaker, with    a specific focus on the type of commitment being made on the part of either    the speaker or the hearer to the truth or purpose of the utterance. Illocution is   marked along with the category of Mood (see Section 5.2) by a consonant+vowel Ci+Vi infix to the formative, as previously shown in Table 9 above.</p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction     (+Illocution)</p> Valence Validation OR Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction     (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

Additionally, in Section 6.3.3 we will see that Illocution can    be shown by an affix within a verbal adjunct. </p> <p>The six illocutions  are described below.</p> <p> </p> 5.3.1 ASR The Assertive <p>The ASSERTIVE is used to express propositions    which purport to describe or name some act, event, or state in the real world,    with the purpose of committing the hearer to the truth of the proposition. Thus,    an utterance in the ASSERTIVE illocution is one that can    be believed or disbelieved, and is either true or false. Such utterances would    include general statements, descriptions, and explanations. </p> <p> </p> 5.3.2 DIR The Directive <p>The DIRECTIVE illocution is for the purpose of committing    the hearer to undertake a course of action represented by the proposition, where    the proposition describes a mental wish, desire, or intention on the part of    the speaker. Thus, an utterance in the DIRECTIVE is one    that is neither true nor false because it is not describing something that purports    to exist in the real world; rather, it describes an act or situation which can    potentially be made real, i.e., that can be fulfilled or carried out. Such utterances    include commands, orders, and requests and would generally be marked in Western    languages by either the imperative, optative, or subjunctive moods. The commitment    on the part of the hearer is not belief or disbelief, but rather whether to    obey, comply with, or grant. The DIRECTIVE is also used for \u201ccommissive\u201d types of statements such as promises, vows, pledges,    oaths, contracts, or guarantees, where the    statement is a wish or command directed at oneself.</p> <p> </p> 5.3.3 IRG The Interrogative <p>The INTERROGATIVE is used for utterances corresponding to questions in other languages. The commitment on the part of the listener in regard to the INTERROGATIVE is one of compliance or non-compliance in divulging the information sought,    and the truth value of the utterance is neutral pending the reply.</p> <p> </p> 5.3.4 ADM The Admonitive <p>The ADMONITIVE is used for admonitions and warnings, corresponding to English phrases such    as \u2018(I) caution you lest\u2026,\u2019 \u2018(I) warn you against\u2026,\u2019    or \u2018Be careful not to\u2026.\u2019 The utterance is neither true nor    false because it describes only a potential act or situation which may occur    unless avoided. The commitment on the part of the hearer is to assess the degree    of likelihood of the potentiality, followed by a choice whether to heed or ignore/defy    the utterance. </p> <p> </p> 5.3.5 HOR The Hortative <p>The HORTATIVE is used for statements that are untrue or unreal, but wished to be true or real, corresponding to English phrases such    as \u2018if only\u2026\u2019, or \u2018were it that\u2026.\u2019</p> <p> </p> 5.3.6 DEC The Declarative <p>The DECLARATIVE is used for utterances    whose purpose is to themselves effect a change upon the real world, based upon    convention, cultural rules, law, subjective authority, or personal authority    or control of a situation. The commitment imposed upon the hearer is one of    recognition or non-recognition. Such utterances include declarations, announcements,    proclamations, and various \u201cperformative\u201d expressions. Certain languages    mark this function of a verb using a mood known as hortative. Examples would    be: I dub thee \u201cClown Master\u201d!, The king will hear all grievances      at noon each day, This court is now in session, We hereby declare this treaty      null and void!</p> <p> </p> 5.3.7 Examples of Illocution in Use <p>     Aidhaw\u00e9l.

LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p></p> 5.4  CASE-FRAMES AND RELATION <p>Virtually all languages allow for sentences to be hierarchically    embedded within other sentences, a process termed subordination.    In Western languages, the embedded sentence becomes either a subordinate clause    or a relative clause, explicitly introduced by a conjunctions such as \u2018that,\u2019    \u2018which,\u2019 \u2018who,\u2019 \u2018where,\u2019\u2018although,\u2019\u2018if,\u2019\u2018while,\u2019\u2018whereas,\u2019    or a preposition followed by a conjunction, such as \u2018through which,\u2019\u2018by    whom,\u2019etc. In English, such clauses can also occur as an infinitive or    gerundial verb construction. Both relative and subordinate clauses are illustrated    in the following sentences:</p> <p> The dog that ate my hat belongs to      them.     I want him to stop shouting.     The committee voted to fire the superintendant.     We demand (that) you give us equal pay. Although he\u2019s a college graduate, he acts like a child.     This is the slot through which the letter is passed. In case you\u2019re unaware, I\u2019ll be leaving next      month.     The boy walking toward us is my nephew.</p> <p>The Ithkuil equivalent to relative or subordinate clauses is    known as a case-frame, or simply, frame. Conceptually,    the sentence to be embedded is simply treated as a noun participant to the main    verb of a sentence and is therefore marked for case like any other noun. For    example, take the following two sentences:</p> <p>She and I were working together.      The two nations were at war.</p> <p>Suppose we want to use the second sentence to provide a temporal    context for the first sentence. In English we could do this by subordinating    the second sentence to the first using the conjunction \u2018while,\u2019    as in She and I were working together while the two nations were at war.    Alternately, we could create a relative clause by inserting a connecting prepositional    phrase, as in She and I were working together during the time (that) the      two nations were at war.</p> <p>In Ithkuil, temporal context for a sentence may be provided    by a noun in any of the temporal cases such as the CONCURSIVE (see Sec. 4.6.3). A word    such as \u2018summer\u2019 or \u2018famine\u2019 would be placed in the CONCURSIVE case to create a sentence corresponding to:</p> <p>She and I were working together during the summer.     She and I were working together at the time of the famine.</p> <p>Just as the single words \u2018summer\u2019 and \u2018famine\u2019    are placed in the CONCURSIVE case, so an entire sentence    such as The two nations were at war can be placed in the CONCURSIVE case to provide the temporal context for the main sentence. In other words,    Ithkuil treats the entire subordinate sentence as a noun phrase to be declined    into any required case. That is the purpose of a frame, to place sentences into    noun cases. By doing so, Ithkuil accomplishes the same task for which Western    languages use relative and subordinate conjunctions. In theory, any sentence    can be placed into any of the 96 cases and inserted into another sentence wherever    a simple noun might be placed in the sentence using that same case.</p> <p> </p>   5.4.1 Relation and the Placement of Frames <p>To construct a case-frame, the second-order sentence (i.e.,    the sentence to be subordinated) is placed in the main sentence at the point    where a noun declined for the required case would appear. The actual case of the second-order sentence is indicated in the verbal  formative  the same way as for nominal formatives, i.e., via the Vc affix in Slot VII. Additionally, the syllabic stress of the formative will change to show FRAMED Relation, explained in the next paragraph. </p> <p>Relation is a binary category in Ithkuil, having two values. The main verbal formative of an Ithkuil sentence is in UNFRAMED Relation, marked by  penultimate (second-to-last) syllabic stress or by ultimate (final) stress if the formative has FORMAL Designation (see Section 3.7). Once a verbal formative is subordinated within a case-frame, it takes FRAMED relation, shown by antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllabic stress or by preantepenultimate (fourth-from-last) syllabic stress if the formative has FORMAL Designation. </p> Table 10: Relation x Designation <p>STRESS = 2 relations x                2 designations</p> <p>UNFRAMED Relation</p> <p>FRAMED Relation</p> <p>IFL Designation</p> <p>FML Designation</p> <p>IFL Designation</p> <p>FML Designation</p> <p>penultimate stress</p> <p>ultimate stress</p> <p>antepenultimate stress</p> <p>pre-antepenultimate stress</p> <p> If the formative does not have enough syllables to allow for penultimate or pre-antepenultimate stress,  any morphophonological Slot (see Section 2.1.1) which is unfilled due to having its unmarked default value, can instead be marked by its alternate default value, e.g., the affix -a- in Slot IV (see Section 2.2.2), and/or the infix -w\u00eb- in Slot IX (see Section 5.5), and/or the affix -a- in Slot XII (see Section 3.6), in order to create a sufficient number of syllables.</p> <p>If the case-frame is inserted at the beginning or    into the middle of the main sentence, the final word of the case-frame will usually   carry a special suffix, -t\u2019 (see details in Section 7.4.13), which signifies the end of the frame if    this will help to avoid confusion as to which words in the sentence belong inside    the frame (i.e., with the secondary sentence), and which belong to the main  sentence. A case-frame usually has its verb appear    as the first element of the case frame. </p> <p>In general, the perspective of the verb in    the secondary sentence operates independently from that of the main verb, however,    it is also common for the perspective of the verb in the secondary sentence    to be placed in the ABSTRACT, which has the effect of    deferring all Perspective information about the verb to the main verb, similarly to the way English subordinate    clauses using gerunds and infinitives defer all tense information to the main  verb of the sentence.</p> <p> </p>  5.4.2 Reinterpreting the Notion of a Relative Clause <p>There is no direct equivalent in Ithkuil to the relative clauses    of Western languages. Ithkuil treats such clauses the same as subordinate clauses    using case-frames as described above. However, the manner in which this is done,    while ultimately logical, is somewhat complex and confusing from a Western perspective.    Therefore, to analyze how Ithkuil reinterprets Western relative clauses into    subordinate case-frames will first require us to review the nature of relative    clauses in Western languages such as English. </p> <p>A relative clause refers to an imbedded sentence which modifies    or describes a \u201chead\u201d noun in the main clause. There are two types    of relative clauses, restricted (or dependent) and unrestricted (or independent).    The two types are illustrated in the following English sentences.</p> <p>RESTRICTED CLAUSE     (1) Lions that like chasing their tails can be seen at        any circus.     (2) That book (that) I just finished reading was written        by a priest.</p> <p>UNRESTRICTED CLAUSE     (3) Lions, which like chasing their tails, can be seen        at any circus.     (4) That book, which I just finished reading, was written        by a priest.</p> <p>In the first sentence, the clause \u2018that like chasing    their tails\u2019 refers to a specific type of lion found at a circus (i.e,    not all lions chase their tails). Similarly, the clause \u2018(that) I just    finished reading\u2019 in the second sentence is restricted in that it is considered    by the speaker as being necessary in order to identify which book is being talked    about, i.e., without the clause, the listener would not know which book the    speaker was referring to.</p> <p> Note the difference in meaning, however, when comparing the    first two sentences to the third and fourth sentences. In the third sentence,    the speaker implies that all lions chase their tails regardless of whether they    are in the circus. In the fourth sentence, the identity of the book is already    known to the listener, and the speaker is merely providing two additional facts    about it: the fact that he just finished reading it and the fact about its author.    Notice that in English, an unrestricted relative clause is set off in writing    by commas and cannot begin with \u2018that\u2019 (rather \u2018which\u2019    or \u2018who\u2019 must be used); also, such clauses are normally spoken in    a lowered intonation with juncture (i.e., brief pauses) immediately before and    after the clause.</p> <p> 5.4.2.1 Restricted Clauses. Ithkuil treats the above notions    about relative clauses in a different way. We will first analyze how Ithkuil    creates equivalents to restricted relative clauses. This can best be approached    by analyzing the underlying sentences which give rise to the main and relative    clauses. Analyzing Sentence No. 2 above, it can be broken up into two discrete    sentences:</p> <p>That book was written by a priest. (= A priest wrote that      book.)     I just finished reading that book.</p> <p> In Ithkuil, the sentence which will be functioning as the    main sentence acts as a \u201ctemplate\u201d in which the secondary sentence    is placed. The particular place in the template to be filled is dependent on    what semantic role, i.e., case (see Chapter      4) the secondary sentence is to fill. Note that the common point of reference    of the two sentences is \u2018that book.\u2019 In the main sentence, \u2018that    book\u2019 functions in the semantic role of CONTENT (See Sec.      4.1.2), superficially equivalent to the direct object of the ABSOLUTIVE subject \u2018priest\u2019, therefore, the main sentence becomes the template    \u2018A priest wrote X\u2019 where X is in the OBLIQUE case (See Section 4.3.1).    Meanwhile, in the secondary sentence, the noun which is the common point of    reference (what in Western grammar would be called the \u201chead\u201d of    the relative clause) is marked with an affix indicating such. So we now have    the two sentences as:</p> <p>A priest wrote [ ]. I just finish reading that book-H. </p> <p>The \u2018-H\u2019 in the second sentence    above is meant to represent an affix marking the \u201chead\u201d or common    reference point between the two sentences. At this point, Ithkuil inserts the    second sentence as a case-frame into the empty \u201cslot\u201d based on the    semantic role it will be playing, in this instance the role of CONTENT marked    by the OBLIQUE case (see Sec.      4.3.1).</p> <p>A priest wrote [OBL]. I just finish      reading that book-H. </p> <p>As described in Sec. 5.4.1 above, the verb    of the secondary sentence  takes    the relevant case marker (OBLIQUE).</p> <p>A priest wrote I just finished reading-OBL that book-H.</p> <p>Reverse translating this sentence back to English, the closest    literal translation would be the rather awkward construction: A priest wrote      what I just finished reading, that book. However, this is how Ithkuil translates    the English sentence \u2018A priest wrote that book that I just finished reading.\u2019</p> <p>Two observations can be noted from the Ithkuil sentence. First    of all, unlike Western languages, the main clause contains no \u201chead.\u201d    Instead, the \u201chead\u201d is marked from within the imbedded clause. Secondly,    there is no difference between this process and the rendering of other types    of subordinate clauses using case-frames, as the main sentence was rearranged    (or reinterpreted) to provide a slot for the semantic role of the imbedded sentence,    the exact same way that subordinate clauses are constructed in Ithkuil. Therefore,    as was previously stated, Ithkuil makes no distinction between subordinate and    relative clauses.</p> <p>Similarly, the other example sentence from above, Lions    that like chasing their tails can be seen at any circus would become in    Ithkuil: At any circus one can see certain lions-H like to chase-OBL their tails. A literal    translation into English would be: At any circus one can see (that) certain      lions like chasing their tails.</p> <p> 5.4.2.2 Unrestricted Clauses. As for independent or unrestricted    clauses, as shown in example sentences (3) and (4) earlier, Ithkuil treats these    differently still. In Western languages, an unrestricted clause does not help    to identify a noun or provide a context for it, but simply adds additional information    about an already identified noun. Thus, unrestricted relative clauses serve    a wholly different cognitive-semantic purpose than restricted clauses, a fact    hidden by their nearly identical surface structures. Ithkuil acknowledges this    profound difference at the overt sentence level by not subordinating any clause    at all. Rather, the two sentences are given co-equal status as main clauses    and simply joined by a coordinating affix. Thus sentences (3) and (4) from earlier    become:</p> <p>One can see lions at any circus and they like chasing      their tails.

The CORRELATIVE case (discussed in Section          4.5.25) is used to create case-frames which are semantically equivalent to the English phrase \u2018that/which/who    is/are\u2026\u2019 Such a case-frame would be used in conjunction with specific Functions (see Section 5.1) to convey whether the relationship of the relativized clause to the main clause is one of description, copula identification, etc. </p>   5.4.3 Example of Case-Frames in Use \u00c2ffapka\u00a0 gvilevum\u00a0  \u203exh\u00e9i\u2019aica\u00a0 ek\u0161a\u00e9\u0163\u00a0 odralek<sup>h</sup>\u00e1\u00a0  gvoecua\u0163.

This is especially useful in describing phenomena    that occur in sudden bursts of short duration, e.g., flashing, sputtering, blinking,    alternating, etc. Phase functions closely with the morphological category of    Extension, previously described in Sec.      3.4, to specify the durational nature, starting and ending, and operative    pattern of a state, action or event. </p> <p>The nine phases are the CONTEXTUAL,      PUNCTUAL, ITERATIVE, REPETITIVE, INTERMITTENT, RECURRENT, FREQUENTATIVE, FRAGMENTATIVE,    and FLUCTUATIVE. They are marked by  the Cv affix to a formative, depending on the  sanction    (and potentially the illocution) of the verb (discussed in Sections 5.6 and 5.3 respectively). The Cv affix is normally placed in Slot V of the formative\u2019s morphological structure, unless the formative contains an incorporated root (see Section 6.4), in which case Cv is placed in Slot I. (In Section 6.3.3 we will see that Cv can alternately be placed within a verbal adjunct.)</p> <p></p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +     Sanction (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation OR Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR Phase +      Sanction      (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

However, if the categories of Phase, Sanction, Illocution, and Valence are all in their default modes (i.e., CONTEXTUAL phase, PROPOSITIONAL Sanction, ASSERTIVE illocution, and MONOACTIVE valence), then they  normally remained unmarked, i.e., the Cv and VL affixes are deleted and Slots V and VI will be unfilled.</p> <p> NOTE: If Slots V and VI are filled (whether by the Cv + VL infixes or by the Cx + Vp infixes discussed in Section 6.4), it becomes necessary to be able to distinguish them from the Cr + Vc root + case infixes in Slots VII and VIII (so the reader/listener will be able to tell which consonants and vowels belong to which morpho-phonological slot). This is accomplished in either of two ways:</p> <ol> <li>The Vr vocalic affix in Slot IV must be filled and must be followed by an additional glottal stop \u2019. It is this inserted glottal stop that clues the reader/listener that Slots V and VI are filled. </li> <li>Or, if the formative is unmarked for Mood and Illocution (i.e., the formative has FACTUAL mood and ASSERTIVE illocution), then this Mood/Illocution combination becomes marked by the infix -w\u00eb- in Slot IX. This option is available only where Slots V and VI are filled by Cx + Vp infixes, not  Cv + VL infixes.</li> </ol> <p>The values for the Cv affix are  shown in  Tables 11(a) through 11(f) below. Note that if the formative\u2019s Illocution is already shown  by the Ci+Vi infix in Slot IX, then illocution is NOT shown via the Cv infix. In such a case, the Cv infix will display ASSERTIVE illocution only (as a default), i.e., only the values from Table 11(a) below will be utilized for Cv. </p> <p> Tables 11(a)-(f): Cv infixes:\u00a0 9

The Category of Sanction is explained in Section 5.6.</p> <p> </p> 5.5.1 CTX The Contextual <p>The CONTEXTUAL is the default phase,    describing a single act, condition, or event as a relatively brief (but not    instantaneous), single holistic occurrence considered once, where the actual    duration of the occurrence is not relevant in the particular context. It can  be visually represented along a progressive timeline by a short dash, e.g., \u2014</p> <p></p> <p></p> 5.5.2 PUN The Punctual <p>The PUNCTUAL describes an act, condition,    or event which is point-like, momentary or instantaneous in nature, such as    an explosion, a flash of lightning, a blow, a single handclap, a collision between    two objects, a stab of pain, a single cough, the clicking of a lock, etc. It  can be visually represented along a timeline by a single point, e.g., \u2022</p> <p></p> <p></p> 5.5.3 ITR The Iterative <p>The ITERATIVE refers to a momentary or    instantaneous event, like the PUNCTUAL above, which repeats    itself in a rapid, on/off, staccato manner, like a machine gun burst, strobe    light burst, an alarm bell ringing, or the quick unconscious tapping of a finger,    the whole comprising a single CONTEXTUAL event. </p> <p>Visual representation: \u2022    \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p></p> <p></p> 5.5.4 REP The Repetitive <p>The REPETITIVE refers to a relatively    brief event of indeterminate or vague duration (i.e., as with the CONTEXTUAL phase above), but repeated in an on/off staccato manner, like a car horn being    honked repeatedly in a fast steady rhythm, or an automatic machine press. Visual    representation: \u2014 \u2014  \u2014\u2014</p> <p></p> <p> </p> 5.5.5 ITM The Intermittent <p>The INTERMITTENT is similar to the ITERATIVE above, identifying a repetitive occurrence of a PUNCTUAL event, however, unlike the ITERATIVE, the duration of    time between repetitions is relatively long and contextually relevant. It would    be used in describing the downbeat pattern of a pop song, the ongoing snapping    of fingers to music, the steady one-drop-at-a-time dripping of a faucet, etc. </p> <p>Visual representation: \u2014 \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 </p> 5.5.6 RCT The Recurrent <p>The RECURRENT is to the REPETITIVE as the INTERMITTENT is to the ITERATIVE.    It indicates a slow repetition of a CONTEXTUAL event,    where the duration between occurrences is relatively long and contextually relevant.    Exemplified by the sounding of a foghorn, or the ongoing hooting of an owl. </p> <p>Visual representation: \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014 </p> 5.5.7 FRE The Frequentative <p>The FREQUENTATIVE indicates an iterative    occurrence (a single set of punctual repetitions) which in turn repeats at intervals,    the whole considered as a single CONTEXTUAL event. Examples    would be the repetitive sets of hammerings of a woodpecker or the repeated short    bursts of a jackhammer.</p> <p>Visual representation: \u2014\u2014\u2022    \u2022 \u2022\u2014 \u2022 \u2022      \u2022\u2014 \u2022 \u2022        \u2022\u2014 \u2022 \u2022          \u2022  </p> 5.5.8 FRG The Fragmentative <p>The FRAGMENTATIVE indicates a random    pattern of punctual occurrences, the whole considered as a single CONTEXTUAL event. </p> <p>Visual representation: \u2014\u2014\u2022    \u2022\u2014 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2014\u2014\u2022      \u2022 \u2014\u2022 \u2022 \u2022        \u2022 \u2022\u2014\u2014 \u2022 \u2014\u2022          \u2022  </p> 5.5.9 FLC The Fluctuative <p>The FLUCTUATIVE indicates a random pattern    of both punctual and longer occurrences. An example would be the \u201csputtering\u201d    of a lighted fuse, the random patterns of tongues of flames, the chirping of    birds in the wild, etc. </p> <p>Visual representation:\u2014\u2014    \u2022 \u2022 \u2014\u2014 \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 \u2022\u2014  \u2014\u2014\u2022      \u2022 \u2014 \u2022      \u2022 \u2022 \u2014\u2022      \u2022\u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p> </p> 5.5.10 Examples of Phase in Use <p>     Hwe\u2019makl\u00e1s.\u00a0\u00a0 (OR\u00a0\u00a0 Hwekl\u00e0s\u00fcrn.)

In everyday terms, this corresponds to whether the utterance    is a neutral proposition or assertion, an allegation, a rebuttable presumption,    a counter-argument, a refutation of an allegation, a rebuttal, etc.</p> <p>There are nine sanctions: the PROPOSITIONAL,    EPISTEMIC, ALLEGATIVE, IMPUTATIVE, REFUTATIVE, REBUTTATIVE, THEORETICAL, EXPATIATIVE,    and AXIOMATIC. Sanction is shown by  the Cv affix to a formative, depending on the  phase    (and potentially the illocution) of the verb (discussed in Sections 5.5 and 5.3 respectively). The Cv affix is normally placed in Slot V of the formative\u2019s morphological structure, unless the formative contains an incorporated root (see Section 6.4), in which case Cv is placed in Slot I. (In Section 6.3.3 we will see that Cv can also be placed within a vebal adjunct.)</p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation OR Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase +  Sanction        (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

See Section 5.5 above for details of these requirements.</p> <p>Each sanction is explained in the sections below. </p> 5.6.1 PPS The Propositional <p>The PROPOSITIONAL sanction  is the default sanction, indicating the utterance represents    a neutral proposition or assertion of ontologically objective fact, i.e., a    statement of fact irrespective of third-party opinion, belief, or interpretation.    Example of such statements would be That is a mountain, or I\u2019m  hungry. </p> 5.6.2 EPI The Epistemic <p>The EPISTEMIC sanction  identifies an utterance as being a statement    of shared knowledge or conventionalized fact whose ontology is human convention    (i.e., agreed-upon knowledge) as opposed to objective fact irrespective of human    knowledge. An example would be That mountain is Mount Fuji or The  U.N. tries to relieve hunger in the Third World. </p> 5.6.3 ALG The Allegative <p>The ALLEGATIVE sanction identifies an utterance    as an ontologically subjective assertion or allegation, i.e., a proposition    expressing one\u2019s opinion, belief, or interpretation, open to challenge    or refutation. Examples would be That mountain is beautiful or No  one in the United States goes hungry. </p> 5.6.4 IPU The Imputative <p>The IMPUTATIVE sanction  identifies an utterance    as a rebuttable presumption, i.e., an assertion, whether ontologically objective    or by convention, that is to be assumed true unless and until rebutted by a    sufficient counter-argument or other evidence. Examples would be He knows      how to drive [e.g., because he owns a car] or She can\u2019t be hungry  now [e.g., because I saw her come out of the restaurant].  </p> 5.6.5 RFU The Refutative <p>The REFUTATIVE sanction  identifies an utterance    as a counter-allegation, refutation, or rebuttal of a previous assertion, allegation    or presumption, where the counter-allegation, refutation, or rebuttal is epistemic    in nature, i.e., based on shared human knowledge as opposed to ontologically  objective fact. </p> 5.6.6 REB The Rebuttative <p>The REBUTTATIVE sanction  identifies an utterance    as a counter-allegation, refutation, or rebuttal of a previous assertion, allegation    or presumption, where the counter-allegation, refutation, or rebuttal is based    on ontologically objective fact, irrespective of subjective opinion, belief,  or interpretation. </p> 5.6.7 THR The Theoretical <p>The THEORETICAL sanction  identifies an utterance  as a testable hypothesis or potentially verifiable theory. </p> 5.6.8 EXV The Expatiative <p>The EXPATIATIVE sanction  identifies an utterance  as a hypothesis or theory that is not necessarily provable or verifiable. </p> 5.6.9 AXM The Axiomatic <p>The AXIOMATIC sanction  identifies an utterance    as a conclusive presumption, i.e., a statement of ontologically objective, pan-experiential    fact not open to rational argument or refutation. Examples would be Gravity      is ubiquitous, or Hunger is caused by not consuming enough food.</p> 5.6.10 Examples of Sanctions In Use <p>      T<sup>h</sup>em-mp<sup>h</sup>\u00e2mnas\u00a0 osmuil.

LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 5.7 VALENCE <p>In Ithkuil, the term Valence is used to refer    to the manner of participation of two separate entities or parties to any given    verb, i.e., participation by one party automatically implies participation by    another party to the same act, event, or state in either a parallel, corollary,    or complementary fashion. Such dual participation occurs naturally in the verbs    of world languages and is the province of what is known as \u201cco-active\u201d    verbs. While all languages implicitly have co-active verbs, Ithkuil explicitly    shows this dual participation in a formal and systematic way. To illustrate    the concept of co-activity in English compare the following pairs of sentences:</p> 1a) I found an old man. \u2192 1b) I found an empty can. 2a) I threw the ball at Sam. \u2192 2b) I threw the ball at the window. 3a) I performed in front of her. \u2192 3b) I performed in front of the wall. <p>Note that the first member of each sentence pair has an animate    object of the verb (an old man, Sam, and her), while the second    member of each pair has an inanimate object (an empty can, the window, and the wall). Now compare this set of sentence pairs to the similar set below: </p> 1c) I met an old man. \u2192 1d) * I met an empty can. 2c) I threw Sam the ball. \u2192 2d) * I threw the window the ball. 3c) I entertained her. \u2192 3d) * I entertained the wall. <p>The asterisk * indicates that the second sentence of these    pairs is semantically unacceptable to English speakers. Why? The second set of sentence pairs parallel the first set except    that the verbs find, throw at, and perform have been    replaced by the semantically similar meet, throw, and entertain.    Nevertheless, the use of inanimate objects with these latter three verbs appears    unacceptable. The reason is that the verbs in the first set are \u201cmono-active,\u201d    i.e., they do not require that the object participate in the action in any way,    whereas the verbs in the second set are \u201cco-active,\u201d requiring that    the object participate in the action along with the subject. Thus, while I can find an old man without the old man doing anything about it or even    being aware of it, I cannot meet an old man without the old man also    meeting me. I can throw a ball at Sam without Sam noticing, but if    I throw Sam a ball it implies that he is expected to participate by    catching it. Similarly, I can perform in front of someone even if they\u2019re    asleep, but I can\u2019t entertain them unless they are participating    in the situation by observing me. The participatory relationship involving the second party of    a co-active verb differs depending on the context. It can be a parallel relationship    (i.e., both parties participate identically) as implied by the English adverb    \u2018together\u2019 in He and I jog together, or a reciprocal relationship    as in the sentence I met the old man (i.e., and so he met me) or in    verbs used with the adverbial phrase \u2018each other,\u2019 as in We      love each other. The relationship can be one of accompaniment as in I        played along with him (e.g., as he sang), or a complementary relationship    as in I threw Sam the ball (i.e., and so he caught it).Other sorts of co-active relationships are possible. It is    the differences in these relationships that are systematized in Ithkuil into    the category called valence. In English and other languages co-activity is rarely    explicit and systematic (the use of adverbs such as \u2018together,\u2019    \u2018each other,\u2019 or prefixes such as \u2018out-\u2019 as in out-perform are some exceptions), and when lexified within a verb itself, are implicitly    specific to that verb, giving rise to monoactive/co-active pairs such as find/meet,      throw at/throw, perform/entertain, etc. In Ithkuil, co-activity is explicitly shown morphologically,    and the types of co-active relationships, i.e., the valences of the verb, are    systematic and fully productive for all verbs. As a result, no mono-active versus    co-active lexical distinctions are necessary, i.e., all verbs can function monoactively    as well as co-actively.</p> <p>There are fourteen valences in Ithkuil: the MONOACTIVE,    PARALLEL, COROLLARY, RECIPROCAL, COMPLEMENTARY, NONRELATIONAL, DUPLICATIVE,    DEMONSTRATIVE, RESISTIVE, IMITATIVE, CONTINGENT, PARTICIPATIVE, INDICATIVE,    and MUTUAL. Valence is  shown by  the VL affix to a formative,  normally placed in Slot VI of the formative\u2019s morphological structure (following the Cv affix in Slot V), unless the formative contains an incorporated root (see Section 6.4) or a Cs aspect/mood infix in Slot III, in which case VL is placed in Slot II following the Cv affix in Slot I. As per the Note in Section 5.5, the presence of Cv and VL in Slots V and VI require that the Vr infix in Slot IV be followed by a glottal stop \u2019.</p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction       (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation OR Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

It would be used in translating sentences such as The children all sang      together, We both went jogging on the parkway.</p> <p> </p> 5.7.3 CRO The Corollary <p>The COROLLARY valence is similar to the PARALLEL, except that the second party engages in related    activity at the same time as the first party, rather than the same activity.    It would be used in translating sentences such as The children played in      the yard (i.e., each child engaged in a different play activity) or The        band played my favorite song (implying that not everyone in the band was    playing the same instrument, or perhaps that someone in the band sang as opposed    to playing an instrument).</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 5.7.4 RCP The Reciprocal <p>The RECIPROCAL valence indicates identical    activity by each party directed at the other, thus translating the English adverbial    phrases \u2018each other\u2019 and \u2018one another,\u2019 as in They      looked at each other, The clown and the grocer despise one another.</p> <p> </p> 5.7.5 CPL The Complementary <p>The COMPLEMENTARY valence indicates that    the second party performs a complementary activity to that of the first party.    By \u201ccomplementary\u201d is meant an activity different from that of the    first party, but necessary to complete the whole of the joint activity, i.e.,    the \u201cother half\u201d of the joint activity. This is exemplified in sentences    such as The man and his son played catch, Hortense took me into the woods,      The clown read the children a story, My back itches so I scratch it, where \u2018played catch\u2019 implies    the complementary activities of throwing and catching, \u2018took (into the    woods)\u2019 implies someone leading while the other follows,  \u2018read\u2019    implies a reader and an audience, and \u2018itches\u2019 implies scratching.</p> <p> </p> 5.7.6 NNR The Nonrelational <p>The NONRELATIONAL valence indicates that    a second party engages in a completely unrelated activity from the first, i.e.,    an incidental or circumstantial co-activity. There is no direct way to exemplify    this valence in English translation other than to add a periphrastic clause    such as \u2018while the other did something else\u2019 as in He shaved      while she did something else. The way an Ithkuil sentence would utilize    this valence would be in sentences overtly constructed to say, for example,    \u2018They were in the house\u2019 with the NONRELATIONAL valence rendering a connotation of \u2018\u2026where one party was doing one    thing while the other did something else.\u2019</p> <p> </p> 5.7.7 DUP The Duplicative <p>The DUPLICATIVE valence indicates that    the second party copies or repeats the activity of the first party, as in the    sentences Let\u2019s draw a picture (i.e., I\u2019ll draw it first,    then you draw the same picture), They both read that book (i.e., first    one, then the other), I bought a new car (i.e., and now someone else    is buying a new car, too).</p> <p> </p> 5.7.8 DEM The Demonstrative <p>The DEMONSTRATIVE valence indicates that    the first party demonstrates for the second party how to do something or what    to do. Thus an Ithkuil sentence constructed as We played chess with    the verb in the DEMONSTRATIVE valence would mean \u2018I    showed her how to play chess,\u2019 while the sentence constructed as They      fought us in this valence would mean \u2018They taught us how to fight.\u2019</p> <p> </p> 5.7.9 RES The Resistive <p>The RESISTIVE valence indicates that    the second party resists or attempts to avoid participating in the activity    of the first party. This sense can sometimes be suggested in English using the    adverbs \u2018anyway,\u2019 \u2018nevertheless,\u2019 or adverbial phrases    such as \u2018just the same,\u2019 as in sentences such as We took the      children to see the clowns anyway (i.e., they didn\u2019t want to go), They fed me liver just the same (i.e., I can\u2019t stand liver), Nevertheless, he told us the story (i.e., despite our not wanting to    hear it).</p> <p> </p> 5.7.10 IMT The Imitative <p>The IMITATIVE valence indicates that    the second party mimics, imitates, or attempts to duplicate the activity of    the first party.

It is the default version and describes all acts, conditions,    or events which are ends in themselves and not goal-oriented, i.e., are not    focused on an anticipated outcome or final purpose toward which a progressive    effort is being made. </p> <p> </p> 5.8.2 CPT The Completive <p>The COMPLETIVE version is marked by high tone. It describes acts, conditions,    or events which achieve, or are intended to achieve, an anticipated outcome,    i.e., which are oriented toward the achievement of some purpose, outcome, or    final state. Such a distinction is usually handled by word choice in Western    languages. The dynamism of Version can be seen in the following comparisons:</p> <p>PROCESSUAL \u2192 COMPLETIVE</p> <p>hunt \u2192  to hunt down      to be losing \u2192 to lose      to study \u2192 to learn      to be winning \u2192 to win     to strive for \u2192 to accomplish, achieve      to risk \u2192 to defeat the odds; win     to work \u2192 to build, construct, make      to displace; infiltrate \u2192 infest, to take over; vanquish     to pour out \u2192 to drain      to remove (incrementally) \u2192 to eliminate     to increase \u2192 to maximize      to read \u2192 to read to the end; finish reading     to decrease \u2192 minimize      to flank \u2192 to surround     to enlarge \u2192 to make gigantic      to spread upon or over \u2192 to cover, engulf, envelop     to shrink \u2192 miniaturize      to chase \u2192 to catch up to     to eat \u2192 eat      all up      to pursue \u2192 to capture     to compete \u2192 to win      to be pregnant \u2192 to give birth     to throw at \u2192 to hit (with a throw)      to run low on \u2192 to run out of, deplete     to grow \u2192 to grow up      to use \u2192 use      up     to possess, hold \u2192 to keep      to tear/ rip \u2192 to tear/rip up or to pieces     to join together \u2192 to unify      to accelerate, speed up \u2192 to achieve maximum speed     to pour into \u2192 to fill (up)      to bleed \u2192 to bleed to death     to run \u2192 to      run all the way      to descend, go down \u2192 to get to the bottom     to brighten \u2192 to illuminate      to decelerate, slow down \u2192 to stop     to search for, seek \u2192 to find      to polish \u2192 to burnish     to practice \u2192 to perfect      to darken \u2192 to make dark     to ascend, rise \u2192 to reach the top      to explore \u2192 to discover</p> 5.8.3 INE The Ineffectual <p>The INEFFECTUAL version is marked by rising tone. It, and  the INCOMPLETIVE which follows, operate in parallel fashion to    the PROCESSUAL and the COMPLETIVE versions respectively but are specific to acts, events, or states initially    expressed (whether explicitly or implicitly) as unrealized intentions, attempts,    desires, needs, etc., often in conjunction with a modality affix to the verb    (see Section 6.1). Such \u201cunrealized\u201d    verbs are exemplified in the following sentences: I want to dance, She needs      to work, I tried to finish, She must find him, I choose to celebrate. Each    of these sentences in itself does not specify whether the action was \u201crealized\u201d    or not, i.e., just because I want to dance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that    I actually do dance; her need to work doesn\u2019t tell us by itself whether    she in fact will work, etc.</p> <p>The INEFFECTUAL version indicates that    the outcome of an \u201cunrealized\u201d PROCESSUAL verb is unsuccessful. Thus the sentence I want to dance in the INEFFECTUAL would be translated as I want to dance but I\u2019m not going to,    while the sentence I tried to eat in the INEFFECTUAL means I tried to eat but couldn\u2019t.</p> <p> </p> 5.8.4 INC The Incompletive <p>The INCOMPLETIVE version is marked by low tone. It indicates that    the outcome of an \u201cunrealized\u201d COMPLETIVE verb is unsuccessful. It functions identically to the INEFFECTUAL,    except that it refers to a verb that is result/goal-oriented, as illustrated    in the comparative chart shown above for the COMPLETIVE version. Thus, the sentence I tried to eat in the INCOMPLETIVE means I tried to eat all of it but couldn\u2019t.</p> <p> </p> 5.8.5 PST The Positive <p>The POSITIVE version is marked by rising-falling tone. Complementing the INEFFECTUAL, the POSITIVE  indicates an intention brought to reality. Thus the sentence I want    to dance in the POSITIVE would be translated as I      want to dance and so I\u2019m going to, while the sentence I tried        to eat in the POSITIVE means I succeeded in eating          something.</p> <p> </p> 5.8.6 EFC The Effective <p>Likewise, the EFFECTIVE version complements    the INCOMPLETIVE, indicating the same successful effort    implied by the POSITIVE version, only applied to goal-/result-oriented    verbs. Thus I wanted to finish in the EFFECTIVE implies that the desire was successfully carried out; I tried to eat in the EFFECTIVE means I succeeded in eating it all      up. The EFFECTIVE is marked by falling-rising tone.</p> 5.8.7 Examples of Version in Use <p>      \u02c7Ixh\u00e1t\u2019\u00a0 \u00eapal\u00a0  I\u0163kuil\u00a0 efneil\u00a0 t\u00ea.

Such categories    are usually termed \u201cevidentials\u201d or \u201cfactives\u201d in various    non-Western languages which have them. There are 14 validations in Ithkuil, five refer to non-hearsay types of evidence, while nine refer to hearsay situations. These nine hearsay categories are distinguished by a two-fold matrix of whether the source of the hearsay is considered by the speaker to be trustworthy and whether the statement/information is potentially verifiable. The exactitude of Ithkuil evidential categories is impossible to capture in English translation except through cumbersome paraphrase, but can be approximated in a rough way using phrases such as reportedly, presumably, supposedly, purportedly, allegedly, rumour has it, I have a feeling that, etc. </p> <p>The 14 validations are shown by a consonantal prefix Cg  in Slot III.</p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction       (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR     Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

There are 32 aspects in Ithkuil. For the most part, they translate various common adverbial    phrases used in English. </p> <p>Generally, Aspect is usually shown by affixes to a verbal adjunct, since such adjuncts allow for a second aspect to be conveyed, and any other morphological information carried by the adjunct requires the adjunct to carry an aspectual marker as well. However, it is also possible to show a single aspect within the formative itself, by means of the Cs consonantal prefix in Slot III. Such an alernative would be available when Slots I and II of the formative are filled, thus requiring the presence of either Cg or Cs in Slot III. </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction       (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR Aspect ( + Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

The only appearance in Ithkuil of these specialized consonantal clusters is in the Cs affix used in Slot III of formatives (as well as in Slot D of  verbal adjuncts, discussed in Section 6.0).

<p>The thirty-two aspectual categories are explained below. </p> 5.10.1 RTR \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RETROSPECTIVE <p>This aspect operates in conjunction with Perspective (see Sec. 3.3) to create      various equivalents to Western tense categories. With the MONADIC,      the RETROSPECTIVE can be translated by English \u2018have      already\u2019 as in I\u2019ve already done it. With the UNBOUNDED,      the RETROSPECTIVE is equates with the English simple past      tense. With the NOMIC and ABSTRACT,      it adds a sense of \u2018and it\u2019s always been that way\u2019 to the    verb. </p> <p> </p> 5.10.2 PRS \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROSPECTIVE <p>Like the RETROSPECTIVE above, this aspect operates in      conjunction with Perspective to create various equivalents to Western tense      categories. With the MONADIC, the PROSPECTIVE equates with the English future tense. With the UNBOUNDED,      it can be translated by the English future perfect (i.e., \u2018will have\u2026\u2019).      With the NOMIC and ABSTRACT, it      adds a sense of \u2018and it\u2019ll always be that way\u2019 or \u2018from    now on\u2019 to the verb.</p> <p> </p> 5.10.3 HAB \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HABITUAL <p>When used with the MONADIC perspective, this aspect conveys      the idea of \u2018always\u2019 or \u2018continues to\u2019, while with the UNBOUNDED, the English \u2018used to\u2019 construction    offers an equivalent translation, as in She used to come see me on Wednesdays.</p> <p> </p> 5.10.4 PRG \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROGRESSIVE <p>This aspect conveys the idea of an act in progress, similar to the English construction      \u2018in the midst of [verb] + ing\u2019 or the use of the present participle    in Spanish. </p> <p> </p> 5.10.5 IMM \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IMMINENT <p>Conveys that an action, state or event is imminent. Translates phrases such      as \u2018(just) about to\u2019 or \u2018on the verge of\u2019 as in I    think Carl is about to cry. </p> <p> </p> 5.10.6 PCS \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRECESSIVE <p>Conveys that an action, state or event has immediately preceded. Translates      such phrases as \u2018just\u2019 or \u2018just now,\u2019 as in We just    saw a clown in the toy store. </p> <p> </p> 5.10.7 REG \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REGULATIVE <p>Conveys the idea of participation or involvement in an action, state, or event      over an amount of time extending from the past into the future relative to the      contextual present. Translates English phrases such as \u2018engaged in\u2019      or \u2018involved in\u2019 as in Her husband is engaged in construction of    the new bridge. </p> <p> </p> 5.10.8 EPR \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXPERIENTIAL <p>Translates English \u2018ever\u2019 in the sense of \u2018within the realm      of one\u2019s experience\u2019 or \u2018at some point in one\u2019s experience,\u2019      as in Does he ever shut up? Note the EXPERIENTIAL does not equate to \u2018ever\u2019 when it means \u2018always,\u2019 as      in Ever does he seek his destiny nor as an adverb of mere emphasis      as in Was she ever tired.  </p> <p> </p> 5.10.9 RSM \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESUMPTIVE <p>Conveys the idea of an act, state, or event resuming after having previously      ceased, as in The girl resumed singing, or He is starting to laugh        again.  </p> <p> </p> 5.10.10 CSS \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CESSATIVE <p>Conveys the idea of cessation of an event, state or action.

An example would be Mr. Yates returned to golf after    recovering from his stroke. </p> <p> </p> 5.10.14 PCL \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRECLUSIVE <p>Conveys the fact that an action, state, or event takes place from inception      to conclusion all in one contextual segment, translating such phrases as \u2018all      at once,\u2019 \u2018all in one go,\u2019 \u2018without stopping,\u2019    etc. as in Walter drank the entire bottle in one gulp.</p> <p> </p> 5.10.15 CNT \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONTINUATIVE <p>Conveys the idea that an action, event, or state continues on.

Therefore,  a  verbal adjunct can  be used to convey these other categories in order to decrease the number of syllables of the formative and facilitate pronunciation/euphony of the sentence as whole. This is discussed in Section 6.3.</p> <p>The structure of a verbal  adjunct is as follows. Those slots which are exclusive to verbal adjuncts (i.e., not also found in the formative) are Slots B and D: </p> A B C D E F G H (((CL) Ve) Cv) Vm) Cs (Vs (Cb)) [tone]        \u00a0Valence        Level        Phase +     Saction +     Illocution        Modality        Aspect      Aspect <p>       Bias</p> <p>         Extension </p> <p> The Cs aspectual infix in Slot E is mandatory, even if it carries a null value (i.e., no aspect). The Cs consonantal affix will always contain one of the specialized dyssyllabic geminate clusters described in Section 1.2.1.3, written n-n, m-m, l-l, r-r, etc. as well as various other syllabic consonant clusters, e.g., l-m, l-n, r-m, r-n, and r-\u0148. The second member of the dyssyllabic consonant cluster always carries the word stress and tone in a verbal adjunct. It is the appearance of such a dyssyllabic geminate cluster as the last, or second-to-last consonantal form in the word that identifies the word to readers/listeners as a verbal adjunct.</p> <p>The default tone of a verbal adjunct is falling. However, variations in the tone of a verbal adjunct can be used to convey the accompanying formative\u2019s Extension category, in order to simplify the phonetic structure of the Formative's Ca affix (see Chapter 3) for purposes of euphony and ease of pronunciation. This is discussed in Section 6.3.5 below.</p> <p> For an example of a verbal adjunct, the example verb at the beginning of Chapter 5 (Section 5.0) is repeated here: </p> <p>hru\u0161trul-ly\u00f6\u2019\u0148 \u02c9hni\u010d<sup>h</sup>\u00e2\u00e7t\u00e0u\u2019watkw\u00f6u </p> <p>The first word of this two-word phrase is the adjunct, analyzable as follows:</p> A B C D E F G H hr u \u0161tr u l-ly \u00f6 \u2019\u0148 [falling tone]        \u00a0DEMONSTRATIVE valence <p>         SURPASSIVE-RELATIVE level </p>        RECURRENT phase     REFUTATIVE sanction       DIRECTIVE illocution        DESIDERATIVE modality        REGRESSIVE aspect      IMMINENT aspect        COINCIDENTAL      bias        [default EXTENSION] <p> </p> <p> </p> 6.1 MODALITY  <p>Modality corresponds roughly to the function    of both modal verbs in Western languages (e.g., can, may, must, should,    etc.) as well as those verbs which modify a following verb such as to want      to, to choose to, to need to, to offer to, to demand that, etc. However,    in Ithkuil, the effect of such modifications on a verb causes a fundamental    change in the cognitive interpretation of the verb, usually resulting in a modification    of both the Essence (see Sec.      3.5) and the Perspective (see Sec.        3.3) of the verb, as well as invoking the use of the ACTIVATIVE case to mark the \u201csubject\u201d noun (see Sec.          4.3.9). The nature of these modifications is explained as follows: As we saw in Sections    3.5 and 4.3.9,    it is possible in human language to speak about events that are either unreal,    as-yet-unrealized, or alternative versions of reality. Specifically, nouns and    verbs can make reference to hypothetical representations of real-world counterparts    from within an \u201calternative mental space\u201d created psychologically    (and implied linguistically). This alternative mental space is essentially the    psychological realm of potential and imagination. It is seen, for example, in  the following sentences.</p> <p>1) You must come home at once.     2) That girl can sing better than anybody.     3) Our troops should attack at dawn.     4) Mother needs you to come with her.     5) The teacher requests that I dance for you.     6) The man believes clowns are dangerous. </p> <p>Each of the above sentences describe potential or unreal events,    not actual real-world happenings that are occurring or have occurred. In Sentence    (1) no one has yet come home, in Sentence (2) the girl may choose never to sing    again, Sentence (3) does not tell us whether any attack will actually occur,    Sentence (4) does not indicate whether you will come or not, Sentence (5) does    not indicate whether I will dance, nor does Sentence (6) establish whether or    not clowns are, in fact, dangerous.Because the clauses following the verbs must, can, should,    need, request, believe, in the above sentences all refer to unrealized,    imagined, or hypothetical events, the nouns and verbs within those clauses would    be marked in the ABSTRACT perspective (see Sec.      3.3) and the REPRESENTATIVE essence (see Sec.        3.5). The \u201csubject\u201d nouns which invoke the event (the nouns you, girl, troops, mother, teacher, and man in the six sentences    above) would be marked in the ACTIVATIVE case (see Sec.      4.3.9). It should be noted that not all Ithkuil modalities necessarily    invoke hypothetical or unrealized events. For example, in the sentence She      chose to move to Australia, the verb chose signals that the following    clause is spoken of abstractly (i.e., it is the act of choice that is being    talked about, not the move itself), but nevertheless refers to an actual event    (i.e., she did, in fact, move to Australia). Thus, the move to Australia clause would be marked in the ABSTRACT perspective but    would not be marked in the REPRESENTATIVE essence.    Thus, the requirement that an Ithkuil modality construction invoke modifications    in the perspective, essence and case of the associated nouns and verbs is entirely    dependent on the semantics and cognitive intent of the utterance.</p> <p>There are 30 modalities in Ithkuil.  Modality is marked by the Vm vocalic affix in Slot D of a verbal adjunct. </p> A B C D E F G (((CL) Ve) Cv) Vm) Cs (Vs (Cb))        \u00a0Valence        Level        Phase +       Sactions +       Illocutions Modality        Aspect        Aspect        Bias <p> The 30 modalities and their respective Vm affixes are shown in Table 16 below.

Many languages morphologically indicate    degrees of comparison as exemplified by the English suffixes -er and  -est seen in great-greater-greatest, or alternately with the adverbs more and most, as well as their negative counterparts less and least. The Ithkuil comparison schema is much more complex than those found in natural languages and is designed to eliminate various ambiguities that arise from those simpler schemata, as discussed below. </p>  6.2.1 Ambiguity and Under-specification in Natural Languages  <p>The comparison schemata of natural languages  tend to grossly under-specify the exact semantic nature of the comparison. A clear case of such under-specification can be seen in an English example sentence such as Jane is healthier. This sentence can mean any of the following:</p> <p>(a)  Jane's state of health has improved, although she is still unwell.     (b) Jane's state of health has improved so that now she is well (whereas before she was unwell).     (c) Jane's state of health is even better than it previously was (i.e., she was healthy before, but is even healthier now).      (d) Jane's state of health is not as poor as someone else's state of health (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).     (e) Jane's state of health is better than someone else's state of health, so that Jane can be considered healthy while the other is unwell.     (f) Jane's state of health is better than someone else's state of health, even though both can be considered healthy.</p> <p> This ambiguity is not alleviated even when we specify a party to which Jane's health is being compared as in Jane is healthier than Sue, which can mean:</p> <p>(a)  Jane's state of health is not as poor as Sue's although both are unwell.     (b) Jane's state of health is better than Sue's, so that Jane can be considered well while Sue is unwell.     (c) Both Jane and Sue are healthy, but Jane's state of health is even better than Sue's.      (d) Jane's state of health is not as poor as Sue's  (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).</p> <p> This sort of ambiguity allows odd-sounding sentences such as Snow is warmer (e.g., than liquid nitrogen) to be perfectly grammatical. What is important to note about the above analysis is that the words healthier or warmer do not indicate in the actual context of usage whether a person is actually healthy or whether snow is actually warm. Rather English -er and -est (and more and most) as well as their negative counterparts (less and least) merely serve to indicate on a relative scale a relationship between two entities being compared (or where only one party is mentioned, in relationship to some unspecified standard or expectation). Additional statements are needed to clarify the actual context to determine where the entities fall on the quantitative \"spectrum\" or range of the particular quality or attribute pair in question, e.g., unhealthy &lt;\u2014&gt; healthy.</p> <p>The comparison scheme of Ithkuil has been designed to inherently specify such relative comparison while simultaneously specifying placement within the qualitative spectrum, so that ambiguity as to whether \u201chealthier\u201d means the person is well or unwell is eliminated. </p> <p> </p> 6.2.2 Relative Versus Absolute Comparison <p>An additional aspect of Ithkuil comparison is the concept of relative comparison versus absolute comparison. This is an important concept which impacts the truth value of a statement based upon context. Specifically, relative comparison allows for statements to be true within the narrow confines of the context-at-hand, whereas absolute comparison allows for statements to be true without reference to any specific context. This can be illustrated by the following examples.</p> <p>(a) Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky.   (b) That highway is the fastest way into town.</p> <p> Both of these sentences are true in certain pragmatic contexts and not true in others. For example, while Sirius is the most luminous star as seen from Earth, this is merely due to its relative nearness to Earth (8.4 light years) as compared to most other stars. There are thousands of known stars which are larger (and inherently more luminous) than Sirius but are much further away from Earth. So Sentence (a) is true in a relative context but false in an absolute context. Similarly the highway in Sentence (b) may be the fastest way in most conditions, but if there is a traffic jam  or an accident blocking the highway, or if one has access to a private helicopter, then the statement would be false. Therefore, it is only true in a narrow context determined by the pragmatics of the moment it is spoken. Ithkuil allows speakers to specify whether a comparison is to be interpreted within the  context-at-hand (relative comparison) or as an absolute statement irrespective of the context-at-hand.</p> <p> </p>    6.2.3 Comparison Operators (Levels)  <p>There are nine comparison operators for the Ithkuil verb,  called Levels, which specify the comparative relationship involved, e.g., same as, more than, less than, etc. These levels are marked by a word-initial vocalic prefix to the verb, Ve. Each prefix  comes in two varieties, to distinguish between relative versus absolute comparison. Additionally there is an unmarked default zero-level in which no comparison is being made). The presence of a Ve prefix in Slot B of the verbal adjunct requires Slots C And D to be filled by their respective affixes as well.</p> A B C D E F G H (((CL) Ve) Cv) Vm) Cs (Vs (Cb)) [tone]        \u00a0Valence Level        Phase +       Sanction +     Illocution        Modality        Aspect      Aspect <p>     Bias</p> <p>         Extension </p> <p> NOTE: As an alternative to using Ve, Level can also be conveyed by the suffixes -V<sub>1</sub>m\u013c and  -V<sub>2</sub>m\u013c added to the formative (placed in Slot XI), explained in Section 7.4.13 - LVL suffix.</p> <p> </p> <p>  In interpreting the  meaning of the various Levels, the terms used in the formulas refer to the following X-M-(Y) model, where M represents a verb or an adjectival description, X is the \"subject\" of the verb, and Y is the standard being compared to. </p> Sue  dances as well as /        dances better than /        dances worse than       etc. Mary OR Sue is as smart         is smarter than         is less smart than         etc.  Mary X M (Y) X M (Y) <p>Note that the meaning of each Level allows for an interpretation in which there is no Y term so that the standard of comparison is a previous state of X, e.g., the difference between Sue dances better than Mary versus Sue dances better than before.  </p> <p> </p> <p>   Table 17: Ve Level prefixes</p> VL Prefix  Meaning Label Name of Level  RELATIVE ABSOLUTE EQU EQUATIVE a- \u00e2-  X M    \u2019s the same as Y ( or as before) / X is as M as Y ( or as before) SUR SURPASSIVE u- \u00fb / \u00ee- X M    \u2019s more than Y ( or than before) / X is more M than Y ( or than before) DFC DEFICIENT i- \u00f6- X M    \u2019s less than Y ( or than before) / X is less M than Y ( or than before) OPT  OPTIMAL o- \u00f4- X M    \u2019s at its most possible / X is at its most M possible  MIN  MINIMAL  e- \u00ea- X M    \u2019s at its least possible / X is at its least M possible  SPL SUPERLATIVE ai- au- X M    \u2019s at its most yet / X is at its most M yet  IFR INFERIOR ui- iu- X M    \u2019s at its least yet / X is at its least M yet  SPQ SUPEREQUATIVE ei- eu- X M    \u2019s more than or = to Y ( or than or equal to before) / X is more M than or = to Y / before SBE SUBEQUATIVE oi- ou- X M    \u2019s less than or = to Y ( or than or equal to before) / X is less M than or = to Y / before <p>Note that in verbal adjuncts where Valence is marked by a word-initial CL consonantal prefix in Slot A (see Sec. 6.3.4), but there is no Level, the neutral value of Ve in Slot B is \u00eb.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 6.2.4 The Comparison Cases <p>In addition to Level, there are 24 specialized noun cases which identify the exact nature of the comparison in relation to the quantitative spectrum, range, or standard for the particular attribute, quality, or act in question. These  cases are applied to the noun to which something is compared, i.e., the term Y in the above formulas. So, for example, in the Ithkuil translation of the sentence Jane is healthier than her sister, the equivalent to is healthier would be shown by a Level prefix meaning \"more than\" applied to a formative meaning \"manifesting a state of health,\" while the  phrase corresponding to than her sister would be the word sister marked for a case which specifies whether the other noun to which the sister is being compared (i.e., Jane) is now  well, or is nevertheless still unhealthy, etc. </p> <p>It is primarily through the use of these specialized comparison cases that the ambiguities discussed above in Sec. 6.2.1 are eliminated. The meaning of each case as applied to Y, in terms of the X-M-Y formula discussed above, would be: </p> <p>\"in comparison to Y, where X Q in terms of reference standard S\" </p> <p>where Q indicates the change (or lack thereof) in X over time and S indicates an external standard of comparison for M. An example of this formula in use would be where the term Q = \"was previously less M than Y\" and S = \"although X (still) isn't very M compared to  some external standard or expectation of M-ness\" applied to the sentence Jane is healthier than Sue, now disambiguated to mean that Jane, while being in a healthier stated than Sue, still isn't very healthy. </p> <p>There are eight possible values for Q and three possible values for S, rendering a total of 24 possible Q + S combinations. It is these 24 possible Q + S combinations that are rendered as the Comparison cases in Ithkuil. The eight possible values for Q are as follows:</p> 1 was    previously less M (or M \u2019d less) than Y  2 was    previously more M (or M \u2019d more) than Y  3 is    still less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y  4 is    still more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y  5 is    now less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y  6 is    now more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y  7 was    previously as M (or M \u2019d as much) as Y  8 where X    \u2019s previous state of M-ness (or level of M-ing) relative to Y is unknown,    inapplicable or irrelevant <p>The three possible values for S are as follows:</p> A although X (still) isn\u2019t very M compared  to some external standard or expectation of M-ness B where X meets/exceeds some some external standard or expectation of M-ness and Y does  not C where both X and Y meet/exceed  some external standard or expectation of M-ness, where  previously only Y met/exceeded it <p>The eight values of Q  combine with the three values of S to give the specific meanings of  the 24 comparison cases  as shown below in Table 18. As with the 72 primary cases (see Chapter 4) the 24 comparison cases are shown by the Vc infix to the formative in Slot VIII.</p> <p> Table 18: The 24 Comparison Cases (as per the formula: [X] [M] [in comparison to Y] where X Q in terms of reference standard S)</p> Mutation Series  Label Name of Case  Vc Value of Q        (change in X over time) Value of S  (Comparison to external standard)  73 CMP1A COMPARATIVE 1A a\u00ec        where X was    previously less M (or M \u2019d less) than Y        although X (or X and Y) (still) isn\u2019t/aren't very M compared  to some external standard or expectation of M-ness 74 CMP2A COMPARATIVE 2A e\u00ec        where X was    previously more M (or M \u2019d more) than Y        75 CMP3A COMPARATIVE 3A o\u00ec        where X is    still less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y        76 CMP4A COMPARATIVE 4A u\u00ec        where X is    still more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y        77 CMP5A COMPARATIVE 5A a\u00f9        where X is    now less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y        78 CMP6A COMPARATIVE 6A e\u00f9        where X is    now more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y        79 CMP7A COMPARATIVE 7A o\u00f9        where X was    previously as M (or M \u2019d as much) as Y        80 CMP8A COMPARATIVE 8A i\u00f9        where X    \u2019s previous state of M-ness (or level of M-ing) relative to Y is unknown,    inapplicable or irrelevant        81 CMP1B COMPARATIVE 1B  ao        where X was    previously less M (or M \u2019d less) than Y        and where X (or Y) meets/exceeds some some extrenal standard or expectation of M-ness and Y (or X) does  not 82 CMP2B COMPARATIVE 2B  a\u00fc        where X was    previously more M (or M \u2019d more) than Y        83 CMP3B COMPARATIVE 3B  e\u00fc        where X is    still less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y        84 CMP4B COMPARATIVE 4B  o\u00fc        where X is    still more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y        85 CMP5B COMPARATIVE 5B  \u00eb\u00ec        where X is    now less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y        86 CMP6B COMPARATIVE 6B  \u00f6\u00ec        where X is    now more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y        87 CMP7B COMPARATIVE 7B  \u00eb\u00f9        where X was    previously as M (or M \u2019d as much) as Y        88 CMP8B COMPARATIVE 8B  \u00f6\u00f9        where X    \u2019s previous state of M-ness (or level of M-ing) relative to Y is unknown,    inapplicable or irrelevant        89 CMP1C COMPARATIVE 1C  eai        where X was    previously less M (or M \u2019d less) than Y        and where both X and Y meet/exceed  some external standard or expectation of M-ness, where  previously only Y met/exceeded it 90 CMP2C COMPARATIVE 2C  oai        where X was    previously more M (or M \u2019d more) than Y        91 CMP3C COMPARATIVE 3C  eau        where X is    still less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y        92 CMP4C COMPARATIVE 4C  oau        where X is    still more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y        93 CMP5C COMPARATIVE 5C  uai / iau        where X is    now less M (or M \u2019s less) than Y        94 CMP6C COMPARATIVE 6C  uei / ieu        where X is    now more M (or M \u2019s more) than Y        95 CMP7C COMPARATIVE 7C  uoi / iou        where X was    previously as M (or M \u2019d as much) as Y        96 CMP8C COMPARATIVE 8C  u\u00ebi / i\u00ebu        where X    \u2019s previous state of M-ness (or level of M-ing) relative to Y is unknown,    inapplicable or irrelevant        6.2.5 The COS Suffix  <p>Since Level affixes modify a verb directly, there is still a potential for ambiguity due to the fact that Levels and the Comparison cases specify the  relationship between two entities being compared, but they do not specify the particular parameter of the term M. In other words, the  verb \"laugh\" in the SURPASSIVE Level might be best translated as \"out-laugh,\" as in Sam out-laughed George, but we still do not know if this means the laugh was louder,  longer, or \"harder.\" Therefore, verbs marked for Levels often take the COS suffix as well, to specify the parameters of the quality or act in question. This suffix is found in the list of derivational suffixes in Chapter 7, but is shown here as well, for the sake of convenience.

However, the structure of the verbal adjunct, discussed at the beginning of this chapter, allows for each of the aforementioned morphological categories to alternately be displayed via a verbal adjunct rather than a formative. This is often desirable for purposes of phonological euphony or to address the limitations of phonotactic constraints (see Section 1.4). The sub-sections below discuss the specifics on the alternate representations of these categories via a verbal adjunct.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>6.3.1 Alternate Representation of Mood and/or Aspect</p> <p>The categories of Mood  and  Aspect were previously discussed in  Section 5.2 and Section 5.10  respectively. Mood is normally shown (along with Illocution) via the Ci+Vi infix to a formative in Slot IX, although it can alternately be shown along with Aspect via the  Cs affix to a formative in Slot III. However, the use of the Cs affix in Slot III of a formative, unless required by the presence of affixes in Slots I or II, is generally undesirable as its presence adds two syllables to the length of the formative. Therefore, as an alternative,  Aspect and/or Mood can be conveyed by the same Cs affix within a verbal adjunct in Slot E. This Cs affix is mandatory for all verbal adjunct. </p> <p>The second syllable of the Cs affix (i.e., the second member of one of the dyssyllabic  consonant clusters l-l, m-m, n-n, \u0148-\u0148, r-r, l-m, l-n, r-m, r-n, and r-\u0148) always receives the syllabic stress and tone in a verbal adjunct.</p> A B C D E F G H (((CL) Ve) Cv) Vm) Cs (Vs (Cb)) [tone]        \u00a0Valence        Level        Phase +       Saction +       Illocution        Modality Aspect Aspect <p>       Bias</p> <p>         Extension </p> <p> A second verbal aspect can be shown within a verbal adjunct utilizing the Vs affix in Slot F. Each of the 32 aspects, in addition to their consonantal Cs form,  has a vocalic affixual form Vs, shown in the table below. </p> <p> Table 19: Values for Vs Aspectual Markers and Cs Aspect+Mood

shown by the word-final Cb suffix to a formative. As an alternative, however, the same Cb suffix can instead be placed in word-final position on a verbal adjunct (in which case a Vs affix in Slot F becomes mandatory). The forms of Cb used in verbal adjunct are the same as those used with formatives, except that, unlike formatives, there is no preceding glottal stop.

In a formative, they are shown by a combination affix, Cv, placed in Slot V, or if an incorporated stem is present, in Slot I. Alternately, however, they may be shown by the same Cv affix in Slot C of a verbal adjunct (which entails the mandatory presence of a Vm modality infix in Slot D). The forms of Cv for a verbal adjunct are the same as those for formatives, shown in Tables 11(a) through (f) in Section 5.5. </p> A B C D E F G H (((CL) Ve) Cv) Vm) Cs (Vs (Cb)) [tone]        \u00a0Valence        Level Phase +       Saction +     Illocution        Modality        Aspect        Aspect <p>       Bias</p> <p>         Extension </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>6.3.4 Alternate Representation of Valence</p> <p>The category of Valence was previously discussed in Section 5.7, shown by the vocalic prefix, VL in Slot VI, or, if an incorporated stem is present, in Slot II.

However, in order to simplify the phonological structure of the Ca affix for purposes of euphony, Extension may be shown via the tone of the adjacent verbal adjunct. The default tone of a verbal adjunct is falling, which indicates deferral of Extension information to the Ca affix of the formative. Otherwise, Extension is conveyed by the following shifts in tone of the verbal adjunct.</p> <p> Table 21: Extension As Shown by Tone Shifts in Verbal Adjunct</p> Tone Extension Falling [Extension shown by formative] High PROXIMAL Rising INCEPTIVE Low TERMINATIVE Falling-Rising DEPLETIVE Rising-Falling GRADUATIVE <p> </p> <p></p> 6.4 INCORPORATION AND FORMAT <p>Many languages, including English, are able to combine two separate meanings    into a single verb, a process termed conflation. This is illustrated  in the following English sentences:</p> <p>1. He bicycled south. = He traveled south by bicycle.     2. She dolled herself up. = She made herself look as pretty as a      doll.     3. They\u2019re shelving the books. = They\u2019re putting the      books on the shelf/shelves.     4. Slide me a beer. = Give me a beer by sliding it (e.g., along the      bar).</p> <p>The above sentences show four verbs which respectively carry    inherent senses of vector movement, transformation, positioning/placement, and    giving. The patterning of such \u201cconflated\u201d verbs is usually random    and haphazard in any given language. For example, the English to bicycle in sentence (1) means \u2018to travel by means of bicycle,\u2019 not \u2018to    make a bicycle\u2019 or \u2018to be a bicycle.\u2019 On the other hand, the    verb to doll up does not mean to \u2018travel by doll,\u2019 but    rather \u2018to make appear like a doll.\u2019 Yet, to shelve means    \u2018to place on a shelf,\u2019 not \u2018to travel by means of shelves\u2019    or \u2018to make appear like a shelf.\u2019 And none of the verbs in the first    three sentences connotes the idea of giving or conveyance as does slide in sentence (4).</p> <p>As can be seen, verb conflation is essentially a \u201cshort-cut\u201d    way of combining an unspoken primary verbal sense (such as movement, transformation,    placement, giving, etc.) with an overtly expressed verb that conveys a secondary    sense such as means, manner, or location. This can be formally notated for our    four sentences above as follows:</p> <p>He [1:      (TRAVEL+past tense) south] [2: (BY-MEANS-OF) bicycle]      = He bicycled south.</p> <p>She [1:      (CAUSE-TO-RESEMBLE+past tense+reflexive)] [2: (IN-THE-MANNER-OF) doll]      = She dolled herself up.</p> <p>They [1:      (PUT+progressive) the books] [2: (TO-LOCATION-OF) shelves]      = They\u2019re shelving the books.</p> <p>[1: (GIVE+imperative)]      a beer [2: (BY-MEANS-OF) sliding] to me      = Slide me a beer.</p> <p>Note that the particular unspoken covert and overt senses (shown    by the numerals 1 and 2 in the above analyses) are specific to any given verb    and must be subjectively learned by the listener, i.e., a speaker of English    must learn that to hand means to GIVE by MEANS of one\u2019s hand,    but to shoulder does not mean to GIVE by MEANS of    one\u2019s shoulder. </p> <p>Thus, while conflation of verbs presents a potential opportunity    for instantiating verbs with patterns of overt and covert meaning, the lack    of systemization prevents one from knowing with certainty what pattern to use    when attempting to interpret the usage of a verb form. </p> <p>Ithkuil systemizes verb conflation into a productive  scheme, in which any formative stem can be incorporated directly into another formative stem. The operational sense of the incorporated stem and its semantic relation to the primary formative stem is conveyed by a morphological category called format (discussed  in Section 6.4.1 below). The  incorporated stem is shown via the Cx and Vp affixes in Slots V and VI, where Cx indicates the root and Vp its Pattern, Stem and Designation. Format is shown as part of the Vf prefix which also shows the category of Context (previously discussed in Section 3.6).  </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction       (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR       Aspect Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

In Ithkuil, this sense is overtly identified by the format of the verb, shown by the Vf affix in Slot XII. The Vf affix was previously discussed in Section 3.6 on Context.

This is  explained in the sub-sections below for each format:</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.1 SCH The Schematic <p>For verbs carrying DYNAMIC Function (see Sec. 5.1.2), the SCHEMATIC format indicates that the    incorporated stem specifies the manner of the  primary stem. So for example, when translating the English sentence I\u2019m      speeding through dinner [= eating speedily], the Ithkuil sentence would  incorporate the stem corresponding to \u2018speed\u2019 into the stem \u2018eat\u2019 plus SCHEMATIC format to convey a sentence literally translatable as I'm speed-eating dinner [= eating in a manner characterized by speed.] </p> <p>Similarly, the Ithkuil translation of Clouds blanketed    the city would incorporate the stem corresponding to \u2018blanket\u2019 into the stem  for \u2018cover/engulf\u2019 plus SCHEMATIC format to convey a sentence literally translatable as Clouds blanket-cover the city [= cover like a blanket.] </p> <p>For verbs carrying STATIVE Function (see Sec. 5.1.1), the SCHEMATIC format indicates that the incorporated stem characterizes the primary stem, i.e., the primary stem has the characteristics, behavior, or acts like the incorporated stem.</p> <p>For verbs carrying MANIFESTIVE Function (see Sec. 5.1.3), the SCHEMATIC format indicates that the incorporated is equivalent in identity (i.e., a copula relationship) to the primary stem, i.e., the primary stem is the incorporated stem in an existential sense.</p> <p>For verbs carrying DESCRIPTIVE Function (see Sec. 5.1.4), the SCHEMATIC format indicates that the incorporated has the superficial appearance or physically or (metaphorically) resembles the primary stem, i.e., the primary stem resembles/looks like the incorporated stem.</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.2 ISR The Instrumentative <p>The INSTRUMENTATIVE format indicates that the incorporated stem specifies the means,    cause, or instrument of causation of the conflated primary sense, so that the sentence I clubbed him would be translated by incorporating the stem for \u2018club\u2019 into the stem for \u2018hit/beat\u2019 plus the INSTRUMENTATIVE format, rendering a sentence literally translatable as I club-hit him or I club-beat him [= I hit/beat him with a club].</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.3 OBJ The Objective  <p>The OBJECTIVE format indicates that the    incorporated stem specifies the Patient (see Sec.      4.1.1) of the primary stem. So, for example, the Ithkuil translation of She dusted        the table would incorporate the stem \u2018dust\u2019 into the stem \u2018remove\u2019 to render a sentence literally translatable as She dust-removed the table [= removed dust]. Similarly the sentence They fish that river each          spring would incorporate the stem \u2018fish\u2019 into the stem \u2018gather/collect\u2019 to render They fish-gather that river each spring [= gather fish]</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.4 ATH The Authoritive <p>The AUTHORITIVE format indicates that the    incorporated stem specifies the entity of which the primary stem is the indirect/enabling cause or derivational source. So, for example, the Ithkuil translation of the English sentence He sang her cares away (=    his singing allowed her to forget her cares) would incorporate the verb \u2018forget\u2019 into the verb  \u2018sing\u2019 with AUTHORITATIVE format,  the party \u2018he\u2019 in the EFFECTUATIVE case, and the party  \u2018she\u2019 in the AFFECTIVE case.</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.5 PRT The Precurrent The PRECURRENT format indicates that the      incorporated stem specifies an initial event immediately preceding or continuing on into      the main verb , where the initial event is not the cause of the conflated      sense, i.e., the main act/state/event would have occurred anyway, e.g., I        bought some lunch (conflated sense: EAT). First X, then Y (non-causal).  <p> </p> 6.4.1.6 RSL The Resultative <p>The RESULTATIVE format indicates that the    verb specifies the concurrent result of the conflated sense, i.e., an event    which occurs in conjunction with the conflated sense but is also caused    by it, e.g., The plane crashed into the water (conflated sense:    FLY) First X, then Y as a result; X causes Y</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.7 SBQ The Subsequent  <p>The SUBSEQUENT format indicates that the    verb specifies the subsequent cause-and-effect  purpose (not the    concurrent result) of the conflated sense, e.g., I\u2019ll look in      on the stew (conflated sense: GO [to kitchen]) X or the purpose of Y; X in order to Y</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.8 CCM The Concommitant  <p>The CONCOMMITANT format indicates that the    verb specifies an incidental simultaneous event having no causal relationship,    e.g., She wore jeans to church (conflated sense: GO); He sweated      through her recital (Conflated sense: LISTEN) X while Y</p> <p> </p> 6.4.1.9 AFI The Affinitive  <p>The AFFINITIVE format indicates that the    incorporated stem is associated with, represents, or acts in behalf of the primary stem. So, for example, the English sentence \u2018They are a group of sports officiators\u2019 would utilize the stem for \u2018sport\u2019 incorporated into the stem for \u2018officiate\u2019 along with the AFFINITIVE format.</p>    6.4.2 Examples of  Incorporation and Format <p>      H\u00ebtiun-n\u00a0 ivogwa\u0159\u013cokkai\u00a0  \u0163ei.

However, one type of affix to the formative, the Vx+C suffix from Slot XI, operates in a  manner warranting separate analysis.  This chapter  describes the morpho-phonological structure of these Vx+C suffixes (how they are    formed from consonants and vowels), as well as their function. </p> I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV (((Cv) VL) Cg/Cs) Vr (Cx/Cv Vp/VL) Cr Vc Ci +Vi Ca VxC (Vf  (\u2019Cb)) [tone] [stress] <p> Phase +       Sanction       (+ Illocution)</p> Valence Validation       OR       Aspect (+ Mood) Pattern +       Stem +       Function Incorp.Root       OR       Phase + Sanction       (+ Illocution) Pattern + Stem + Designation of Incorp.

Furthermore, we have found that only one such affix can occupy its given slot in the formative\u2019s structure. </p> <p>However, the VxC suffix from Slot XI is different in three respects: (1) it is comprised of both a vowel form and a consonantal form, (2) the vocalic portion of the suffix can mutate, and (3) more than one VxC suffix can occupy  Slot XI in the formative (i.e., VxC suffixes can be strung together sequentially one after the other).</p>  7.1.1 Mutation of the Vowel Vx <p>While the consonantal portion of the suffix, C, is always invariable,    the vocalic portion Vx mutates depending on two morphological factors known as degree and suffix-type. The nine different    degrees will be discussed in detail in the next section below. As for suffix-type,    every consonantal-based Vx+C  suffix falls into one of three types, which    determine what vowel or vowels will come before the invariable consonant    C. The three suffix-types are labelled V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub>,    in reference to the vowel portion of the suffix.</p>    7.1.2 Degree And Degree-Shifting <p>In addition to the three suffix-types, the vowel(s) associated    with suffixes are also determined by degree. There are nine degrees, each of    which has three associated vowel infixes corresponding to the three suffix-types. Table 24 below shows the vowel(s) associated with each suffix-type. </p> <p> Table 24:  Vocalic Infixes for Consonantal Suffixes by Suffix Type </p> Suffix:        -V<sub>1</sub>C Suffix        Type 2: -V<sub>2</sub>C Suffix        Type 3: -V<sub>3</sub>C Degree        1 -iC -iuC / -uaC -ieC Degree        2 -\u00f6C -auC /-oaC  -i\u00f6C Degree        3 -eC -\u00eaC -ioC Degree        4 -\u00eeC / -u\u00ebC -euC / -oeC -oiC / -\u00f6aC Degree        5 -(a)C -\u00e2C -\u00fcaC / -u\u00ecC / -i\u00f9C Degree        6 -\u00fbC / -i\u00ebC -eiC / -eoC  -ouC / -\u00f6eC Degree        7 -oC  -\u00f4C -uoC Degree        8 -\u00fcC -aiC / -eaC -u\u00f6C Degree        9 -uC -iaC / -uiC -ueC <p>Applying the above rules to three example suffixes we can see    in Table 25 below how these suffixes    would actually appear in conjunction with the word eqal \u2018person\u2019 :</p> <p> TABLE 25: Example of Application of Suffixes to a Stem </p> Suffix:      -V<sub>1</sub>k Suffix      Type 2: -V<sub>2</sub>k Suffix      Type 3: -V<sub>3</sub>k Degree        1 eqalik eqaliuk / eqaluak eqaliek Degree        2 eqal\u00f6k eqalauk /eqaloak  eqali\u00f6k Degree        3 eqalek eqal\u00eak eqaliok Degree        4 eqal\u00eek / eqalu\u00ebk eqaleuk / eqaloek eqaloik / eqal\u00f6ak Degree        5 eqalak eqal\u00e2k eqal\u00fcak / eqalu\u00eck / eqali\u00f9k Degree        6 eqal\u00fbk / eqali\u00ebk eqaleik / eqaleok  eqalouk / eqal\u00f6ek Degree        7 eqalok  eqal\u00f4k eqaluok Degree        8 eqal\u00fck eqalaik / eqaleak eqalu\u00f6k Degree        9 eqaluk eqaliak / eqaluik eqaluek <p>   As for the morpho-syntactic function of Degree, it is used    in Ithkuil to create a gradient system for all consonantal suffixes, which generally    indicates the degree to which the semantic concept underlying the particular    suffix applies to the particular stem. This gradient usually extends from zero-degree    (i.e., the particular concept or quality is absent or minimal) to a maximal    degree (i.e., the particular concept or quality is present in totality). We    will see in the tables of suffixes in Section 7.4 how this gradient system is used systematically in many    dynamic semantic contexts. As a preview we can illustrate the meanings associated    with the nine degrees for the suffix -V<sub>1</sub>d.</p> Degree Suffix Meaning  1 -id  wholly lacking in / a complete absence of / not at all 2 -\u00f6d way too little / totally insufficient(ly) / not anywhere enough  3 -ed  not enough / insufficient(ly) / under-[+verb]  4 -\u00eed not quite enough / somewhat insufficient(ly) / slightly under-[+verb]  5  -ad enough (of) / sufficient(ly)  6 -\u00fbd a little too (much) / more than needed / slightly over-[+verb]  7 -od too / too much / over-[+verb]  8 -\u00fcd way too much / totally over-[+verb]  9 -ud nothing but / to the exclusion of all else  There are approximatey 200 different consonantal suffix categories, each    of which divides into the nine degrees discussed above to render over 1800 distinct suffixes. Each degree of a suffix has a distinct meaning, often representing a point along    a continuum in terms of how much or how little the underlying semantic sense  of the suffix category is being manifested by the particular formative.  <p>It is important to remember that, since all morpho-semantic    stems are both nominal and verbal in meaning, all suffixes to a stem have both    a nominal and a verbal meaning. Therefore, the choice whether to translate the    suffixes below into their nominal or verbal meaning is entirely dependent on    the morpho-syntactical structure of the word within the context of its use in    a phrase or sentence as a whole. </p> 7.1.3 Notational Scheme <p>For convenience\u2019 sake, when referring to a particular    suffix of specific type and degree, we will use the notation in the section    above, utilizing a V for the variable vocalic component, a subscript 1, 2, or 3 indicating the suffix-type, followed by a slash and a number indicating the degree. Thus, the suffix    -nt of Type 1 and 4th degree will be written -V<sub>1</sub>nt/4,    while the suffix -r of Type 3 and 8th degree will be written -V<sub>3</sub>r/8, and so forth.</p> <p> </p> 7.2 SUFFIX-TYPES <p>Each suffix category comes in three types, numbered 1, 2, and 3, indicated by variances in the initial vocalic component of the suffix. Use of the Type 1 version of a suffix caries a mere circumstantial meaning applicable to the context at hand in a subjectively incidental, happenstance, temporary, or informal manner, whereas the Type 2 version of a suffix implies a derivational meaning which can entail lexical differences when translating into English.</p> <p>For example,  the Type 1 suffix -up,    i.e., -V<sub>1</sub>p/9, and its Type 2 counterpart    -uip , i.e., -V<sub>2</sub>p/9,    which both mean \u2018exactly similar to\u2026/identical\u2026,\u2019 the    difference in usage being that the Type 1 suffix conveys merely a circumstantial    or incidental similarity, while the Type 2 suffix implies that the similarity    is an integral aspect of the word. In English, such a distinction would most    likely be conveyed by using a different word. For example, note the difference    when we add these two suffixes to the Ithkuil word eqal \u2018person\u2019: eqalup means \u2018identical-looking person,\u2019 whereas eqaluip means \u2018twin.\u2019 In this way, we can say    that the suffix -Vp with Type 1 vocalic infixes conveys a circumstantial    application of its meaning to a stem, while with Type 2 vocalic infixes, it    conveys a derivational application of its meaning (i.e., wholly new concepts    or words are derived from the stem).</p> <p>As for Type 3 suffixes, these are used in circumstances where the meaning of the suffix is meant to be applied not to the formative itself, but rather to the immediately adjacent suffix. This    is somewhat analogous to the way that adverbs can be used to modify descriptive    adjectives in English. For example, in the phrase suddenly blue sky,    it is the blueness that is sudden, not the sky. In Ithkuil, Type 3 suffixes modify another suffix (usually the one following, unless there    are only two suffixes on the stem, in which case the suffix order is irrelevant);    this is done by using Type 3 vocalic infixes. For example, the suffix -Vd/5,    which means \u2018enough / sufficient(ly),\u2019 can be used both circumstantially    (using Type 1 infixes) and derivationally (using Type 2 infixes) to modify a    stem, or can be used to modify only the adjacent suffix (using Type 3 infixes).    Such suffixes must immediately precede    the suffix they are modifying, unless they are in word-final position, in which  case they modify the immediately preceding suffix. This is illustrated below:</p> <p>eqalad: \u2018a      sufficient person\u2019 (i.e., one able to perform the task at hand) eqal\u00e2d: \u2018a recruit\u2019      (i.e., one able to meet performance or entry requirements) eqal\u00fcad\u00fbx:      \u2018a sufficiently large person\u2019 (where suffix -V<sub>1</sub>x/6 = \u2018large\u2019)</p> <p> </p> <p> 7.2.1 Multiple Suffixation and Ordering of Suffixes</p> <p>When adding two or more suffixes to a stem, the suffixes generally    can be added to the stem in any order desired, with the exception of V<sub>3</sub>C suffixes    which modify an adjacent suffix. This latter type must precede the suffix it modifies, unless there are only two VxC suffixes to the word, in which case the order is irrelevant.</p> <p> </p> 7.3 SPECIAL USE OF  V<sub>3</sub>C SUFFIXES <p>Note that when a Type 3 suffix   appears alone in Slot XI, unaccompanied by another VxC suffix, it serves a different purpose than normal. Such lone Type 3 suffixes are used as \u201cshort-cut\u201d ways of displaying a type of adunct we will discuss in Chapter 8, called a personal reference adjunct. In these cases, the consonant portion of the suffix, rather than repesenting its usual suffix category, instead corresponds to one of the numerous personal reference categories we will discuss in Chapter 8, while the  vowel portion of the suffix, rather than corresponding to one of nine degrees, instead correponds to one of  nine noun cases. The details for utilizing these special V<sub>3</sub>C suffixes are discussed in Section 8.1.5.</p> <p> </p> 7.4 LIST OF SUFFIXES <p>The 200 suffix categories are listed in the sections which follow, indicating the difference in meaning for each of the nine degrees. Recall that each of these suffixes may (theoretically) function as both Type 1 and Type 2 suffixes, the latter type often entailing a change of meaning or lexical shift when translating into English.  </p>    7.4.1 Demonstrative Suffixes <p>These suffixes correspond to various determiners and modifying    adjectives in English having to do with denoting or identifying a noun within    a larger context or discourse.</p> -kt DEF Degree Of Definiteness Degree 1 any (number        of) [random selection - NOT quantitative/partitive \u201cany\u201d]; in        any manner Degree 2 almost        any; in almost any (number of) way(s) Degree 3 some X        or other; in some way or other Degree 4 some certain        X ; in some certain way [identity unknown] Degree 5 this X        or that; a certain X or more; in this way or that [identity almost known        \u2013 choices limited] Degree 6 a certain        / a particular; in a certain or particular way [identity ascertainable] Degree 7 presumably        this/that; apparently this X ; in that way presumably [tentatively identified]  Degree 8  this/that/said;        in said manner/(in) that way [identity known] Degree 9 at hand/under        discussion/this one now/instant; in this manner [identity = present context] <p></p> -q\u2019 DSR Degree Of Discretion Degree 1 announced/advertised/heralded;        w/ public disclosure Degree 2 open &amp;        well-known; with full public knowledge Degree 3 open/public;        for all to see/publicly/openly  Degree 4 shown,        open, or available by request/ by request Degree 5 semi-public(ly),        exclusive(ly) Degree 6 own/personal;        personally Degree 7 own private;        privately  Degree 8  secret;        secretly Degree 9 confidential/classified <p> </p> -q<sup>h</sup> INL Degree Of Inclusion Degree 1 not a(ny),        not one, no X whatsoever, none of X; in no such manner  Degree 2 hardly        any, barely any X; in hardly any such manner Degree 3 some few/a        few certain \u2026 ; in a few certain ways Degree 4 some (of)/certain        . . .; in certain ways Degree 5 several        / more than a few / various / in various ways / in several different ways Degree 6 a significant        portion of/a fair number of; in a fair number of ways Degree 7 most/in        most ways Degree 8  almost        every; in almost every way Degree 9 each/every;        in each way <p> </p> -r\u0163 / -\u0163r EXT Exactness of Identity / Identity As a Referent Or Standard Degree 1 nothing        like that X; nothing like that ; in no way similar Degree 2 somewhat        like that X; somewhat so Degree 3 nearly        or almost that X; nearly or almost so Degree 4 just about        . . . / for all intents and purposes Degree 5 kind of        / type of / this sort of; typically Degree 6 such (a);        in such a manner  Degree 7 clear (case        of); clearly / certainly / indeed[in negative sentences = no way / at all] Degree 8  just like        that; just so, thus(ly) Degree 9 the exact        X / the very (one); exactly thus / exactly so <p> </p> -\u0148s FAM Degree Of Familiarity Degree 1 unknowable        / alien; unable to even try X-ing Degree 2 totally        unfamiliar; totally unaccustomed to X-ing Degree 3 unfamiliar;        unaccustomed to X-ing Degree 4 somewhat        unfamiliar; somewhat unaccustomed to X-ing Degree 5 only just        (recently) familiar; only just recently familiar to X-ing Degree 6 somewhat        familiar; somewhat accustomed to X-ing Degree 7 familiar/known;        accustomed to X-ing Degree 8  well-known        / utterly familiar with / ingrained; inherently accustomed or used to X-ing Degree 9 intimate        with; intimately involved with / intimately accustomed to <p> </p> -p SIM Degree Of Similarity Degree 1 opposite;        as different as possible / at the other extreme Degree 2 completely        different/dissimilar; in a totally different or dissimilar way Degree 3 rather        different / barely similar / almost completely different or dissimilar;        in an almost completely different way Degree 4 other [=different];        in another [=different] way Degree 5 somewhat        different, only superficially similar; somewhat differently Degree 6 similar        in the ways that count/similar down deep, some sort of X; similarly at deep        level Degree 7 (somewhat)        similar, only superficially different, sort of like, something like, X-like;        similarly Degree 8  very similar;        very similarly Degree 9 [exactly        the] same, indistinguishable from; in the [exactly] same way <p> </p>  7.4.2 Deictic Suffixes <p>Deictic suffixes refer to the grammatical process of deixis,    the act of pointing to or pointing out.

by a       noun case.\u00a0 For example, the Format       of an incorporated stem \u2018cat\u2019 can be marked as INDUCIVE case (see Sec. 4.3.2) in conjunction with the       main stem \u2018vocalize\u2019 to give a       word meaning \u2018meow.\u2019 </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Twelve consonant forms are used  for these Slot XI suffixes, which combine with the three suffix-types to give  the 36 forms necessary to specify the nine possible configurations and four  possible perspectives of the incorporated stem.\u00a0  In turn, the nine suffix-degrees times eight vocalic Vf

the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 8: Adjuncts <p>The notion of adjuncts was introduced in Section    2.4.2. We have already discussed  details of some kinds of adjuncts \u2014 verbal adjuncts were introduced in Chapter      6. In this chapter,  several  additional types of adjuncts are introduced.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 8.1 PERSONAL REFERENCE ADJUNCTS <p>The first type of adjunct we will analyze are those relating    to personal reference. By \u201cpersonal reference\u201d is meant the grammatical    description of nouns by abbreviated forms of reference. In most languages, this    is accomplished by means of personal pronouns (e.g., English he, she, it, I,    you, him, her, mine, ours, etc.). Generally, personal pronouns are distinguished    by \u201cperson\u201d (1st, 2nd , or 3rd) and case (e.g., compare English    we, us, and ours). Ithkuil accomplishes the equivalent function by means of    personal reference adjuncts, of which there are two types: single-referent and    dual-referent. </p> <p>Like other adjuncts in Ithkuil, personal reference adjuncts are    highly synthetic in their structure, comprised of at least two morphemes and    usually more. Before we examine the componential structure of personal reference    adjuncts themselves, we must first introduce the personal reference categories    they refer to. </p>    8.1.1 Personal Reference Categories <p>The morpho-semantic delineations of Ithkuil personal reference    categorization are based on inclusion or exclusion in relation to an utterance.    These delineations begin with identifying whether or not the party speaking    is included or excluded in relation to the utterance. The next delineation made    is whether the party being addressed (i.e., the audience/listener) is included    or excluded, then finally whether any third party (i.e., a party other than    the speaker and the addressee) is included or excluded.</p> <p>There are 44 personal reference categories in Ithkuil, each    of which is represented by a single consonant affix plus a corresponding falling    or high tone as shown in Table 26 below.

These terms were discussed in detail in Sec.    3.3 on Perspective. For simplicity\u2019s sake, the difference between    a MONADIC third party versus an UNBOUNDED third party can be thought of as the difference between \u2018he/she/it\u2019    and \u2018they.\u2019</p> <p>8.1.1.2   Speaker and Addressee. These terms refer respectively to the party    speaking (in Western grammar the first person), the party being spoken to (the    second person), and a third party being considered or mentioned (the third person).    Unlike the standard six-person matrix common in Western grammar (the three persons    divided into singular and plural), Ithkuil divides personal reference along    logical lines of inclusion versus exclusion in the speaker\u2019s utterance. </p> <p>From the viewpoint of Ithkuil grammar, only a single individual    can speak. Even if there are two or more persons speaking the same utterance    simultaneously it is but a collection of single individuals, each of which is    one speaker. Therefore, the \u201cfirst person\u201d of Ithkuil, the speaker,    can be only MONADIC, never UNBOUNDED.    Thus, in Ithkuil, there is no true equivalent to the word \u201cwe,\u201d    since inherent in the various categories which translate \u201cwe\u201d is    the concept of \u201cI plus some other entity or entities.\u201d From this    we can begin to see how it is the idea of inclusion or exclusion in the speaker\u2019s    utterance that determines the various personal reference categories.</p> <p>The \u201csecond person\u201d in Ithkuil is the addressee,    the person(s) being addressed or spoken to. There can be one addressee, or more    than one addressee, i.e., MONADIC or UNBOUNDED.</p> <p>The \u201cthird person\u201d in Ithkuil is where things get    very complicated, in that a party being referenced who is not the speaker or    the addressee can have many distinctions, including the presence or absence    of animacy, being MONADIC versus UNBOUNDED,    being referred to as a collective entity, being an intangible abstraction, being    indefinite, being an impersonal generic reference, or being a combination of    two or more of these categories. These distinctions are explained below.</p> <p>8.1.1.3   Animate vs. Inanimate. This is as it sounds. As we saw in earlier chapters,    particularly Sec. 4.1, several    important morphological categories in Ithkuil are dependent on whether the party    to the act, condition, or event is a living entity or inanimate. Note that the    distinction between gender (he vs. she) found in most Western languages does    not exist in the Ithkuil personal reference system. </p> <p>8.1.1.4  \u201cMixed\u201d Third-Party Reference. It is possible for the third    party being referenced to be two or more entities of different natures. For    example a speaker could make reference to \u201cI, you, and they\u201d where    \u201cthey\u201d consists of a group consisting of one person (i.e., a monadic    animate entity), three boxes (i.e., a polyadic inanimate entity), and an intangible    concept such as \u2018happiness\u2019 (i.e., an abstract entity). In such    cases, Ithkuil personal reference categories provide for such \u201cmixed\u201d    parties to be included in a particular personal referent.</p> <p>8.1.1.5  Collective Reference. This corresponds to the NOMIC perspective in which a noun can be spoken of as a generic collective. For example,    the word \u2018dog\u2019 in the sentence The dog is a noble beast refers to all dogs in a collective sense, not any dog in particular. This COLLECTIVE category has its own set of personal reference affixes in Ithkuil, depending    on what other entities are included in the context of the utterance.</p> <p>8.1.1.6  Abstract Reference. This corresponds to the ABSTRACT perspective, equivalent to derivational abstract forms such as English nouns    ending with -hood, -ness, etc. In Ithkuil, all nouns can be    spoken of in this abstract sense (e.g., \u201cbookhood\u201d = the    sense of being or functioning as a book), and the personal reference system    provides affixes for this category whose form again depends on what other entities    are included in the context of the utterance.</p> <p>8.1.1.7  Obviative (4th Person) Reference. This category has no equivalent in    Western languages, although it is found in various Native American languages.    It refers to a third party referent other than one previously mentioned, which    would otherwise be identically marked. In Native American grammatical treatises,    this category is usually termed the obviative or \u201cfourth\u201d person.    For example, the English sentence He saw his book is ambiguous because    we are uncertain whether \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018his\u2019 refer to the    same person or to two different persons (i.e., one who did the seeing and another    who owns the book). In Ithkuil, no such ambiguity occurs because the latter    third person referent, if a distinct person from the initial third person referent,    would be marked using the OBVIATIVE, not the third person.    This disambiguation of third person referents is the purpose of the OBVIATIVE.    Its translation into English is therefore dependent on a preceding personal    referent. (See Sec. 8.1.4 below for more information    about the OBVIATIVE).</p> <p>8.1.1.8  Indefinite Reference. This category indicates that the third party    refers to any third party within the specified parameters. For example, the    falling-toned referent v  indicates an indefinite animate party, i.e., English \u2018anyone\u2019 or    \u2018anybody,\u2019 while the high-toned referent  \u00afv indicates an indefinite inanimate party, i.e., English \u2018anything.\u2019 </p> <p>8.1.1.9  Universal Reference. This category indicates that the third party refers    to every third party within the specified parameters. For example, the falling-toned referent  l  indicates a universal animate party, i.e., English \u2018everyone\u2019 or    \u2018everybody,\u2019 while the high-toned referent \u00afl  indicates a universal inanimate party, i.e., English \u2018everything.\u2019 </p> <p>8.1.1.10  Impersonal Reference. This category corresponds to the German pronoun man or French pronoun on, as well as the various circumlocutions    used in English to describe impersonal reference (e.g., \u2018one,\u2019 \u2018you,\u2019    \u2018they,\u2019 the passive voice, and certain usages of \u2018someone\u2019).    Such impersonal reference is illustrated in the following English sentences:</p> <p>\u00b7 One should      never speak to clowns alone. \u00b7 To dance the tango you need a partner. \u00b7 They say it never rains in August. \u00b7 That town is said to be haunted. \u00b7 She just wants to talk to someone without being criticized.</p> <p>8.1.1.11 Inclusivity vs. Exclusivity. Since    Ithkuil personal reference adjuncts are designed to specify who among the speaker,    addressee(s), and any third party is included or excluded in the context of    the utterance, there are many possible personal reference distinctions possible    in Ithkuil for which English has no equivalent pronouns. Such exacting distinctions    would have to be made periphrastically in English, e.g., instead of saying \u2018we,\u2019    the speaker would have to specify \u2018the two of us,\u2019 or \u2018I and    he but not you,\u2019 or \u2018I, you, and they.\u2019 Similarly, the English    word \u2018you\u2019 breaks down into specific meanings equivalent to \u2018you    (singular),\u2019 \u2018you (plural),\u2019 \u2018you (singular) and it,\u2019    \u2018you and those people,\u2019 \u2018you and those things,\u2019 etc.</p>    8.1.2 Single-Referent Personal Reference Adjuncts <p>Adjuncts with one personal referent are termed single-referent    adjuncts and have four forms: (1) a short form, (2) a long form,  (3) a    conjunct form, and (4) a collapsed form, as shown in Table 27 below.  </p> <p>   Table 27:    Morphological Structure of a Single-Referent Personal Reference Adjunct </p> Form 1 (Short Form): C1 + Vc Example: p + oi \u2192 poi Form 2 (Long Form) : C1 + Vc  + Cz + Vz (+ \u2019Cb) Example:    t (w/ high tone) + i + w + u  \u2192 <sup>\u2013</sup>tiwu <p>Form 3 (Conjunct Form): </p> <p> Cs+Vs (+ Cs+Vs...) + C1 + V1 + Cz + Vz (+ \u2019Cb)</p> Example:  f + o + t + eu + y + e  + \u2019\u00e7\u00e7 \u2192 foteuye\u2019\u00e7\u00e7 <p>Form 4 (Collapsed Form): Vc2 + C1 + Vc</p> Example: e + p + oi \u2192 epoi Where: C1 = consonant identifying            Referent 1 [from Table 26 above] Vc = vocalic infix indicating case of Referent 1[see Table              28 below] Cz =  consonantal infix showing the affiliation of Referent 1 (see Table 29 below) Vz = vocalic suffix            showing the Configuration and Essence of Referent            1 in conjunction with syllabic stress (see Table 30 below) Cs = consonantal suffix            for Referent 1 from standard suffix tables Vs = vocalic infix showing the suffix degree and suffix type for              Cs [see Table 24 in Sec. 7.1.2] Cb = consonantal bias            suffix (see Table 15 in Sec.              5.11.1) Syllabic Stress =  indicates essence of Referent 1: penultimate (or monosyllabic) = NRM; ultimate stress = RPV Vc2 = vocalic infix indicating the case of a second instance of Referent 1. The values are the same as for Vc[see Table 28 below] <p>   8.1.2.1 Short Form: Form 1, the short form of the adjunct, consists of a single consonant    (labeled C1 in the diagram) plus falling or high tone,    corresponding to one of the 44 particular referents (as described in Sec.      8.1.1 above). This is followed by a single vocalic suffix Vc indicating the case of the personal referent (see Chapter 4 on Case). The 96  possible values for this suffix are shown in Table 28 below in the column labeled Vc. Note that for Case Nos. 49 through 96, Vc is the same as for the first 48 cases, plus a shift in the tone of the adjunct. Those personal referents which take falling tone shift to low tone, while personal referents that take high tone shift to rising tone. </p> <p>The short form    of a single-referent personal reference adjunct is used when it is clear from    the surrounding context of the utterance which previously identified noun participant    is being referred to, so that it is unnecessary to indicate the Configuration,    Affiliation, or Essence of the referent. The short form    of the adjunct merely indicates the party itself and its case. </p> <p> </p> <p>8.1.2.2 Long Form: Form 2 of the adjunct, the long form, contains an additional consonantal infix Cz followed by a vocalic suffix Vz.   Cz indicates the referent\u2019s affiliation, while Vz indicates its configuration and essence. (See Chapter 3 for an explanation of the Affiliation, Configuration, and Essence categories.) The default form of Cz is shown in Table 28 below in the Column labeled Vc+Cz.Note that for some noun cases (Nos. 18, 43-48, 56-59, and 61), the value of Vc changes when used with Cz in Form 2 of the adjunct, as shown in the table. </p> <p>The long form    of the adjunct is used when necessary to indicate the  Configuration,    Affiliation, and Essence of the referent when the surrounding sentences  do not provide or make clear this information. </p> <p>    Table 28: Short- and Long-Form  Vc (+ Cz) Suffixes/Infixes    for Single-Referent Personal Reference Adjuncts (Default Forms) (Note that due to its vocalic patterning paralleling the patterning of the CMP8C case, the VOCATIVE case is shown out of order in Position No. 48 in this table.)</p> Label CASE Vc Vc + Cz OBL Oblique a -aw- IND  Inducive u -uw- ABS Absolutive e -ew- ERG Ergative o -ow- EFF Effectuative \u00f6 -\u00f6w- AFF Affective i -iw- DAT Dative \u00fc -\u00fcw- INS Instrumental ai -aiw- ACT Activative ei -eiw- DER Derivative ui -uiw- SIT Situative oi -oiw- POS Possessive \u00e2 -\u00e2w- PRP Proprietive \u00ee -\u00eew- GEN Genitive \u00ea -\u00eaw- ATT Attributive \u00f4 -\u00f4w- PDC Productive \u00ebi -\u00ebiw- ITP Interpretative \u00f6i -\u00f6iw- OGN Originative \u00fb -aew- PAR Partitive ia iaw- CRS Contrastive ie iew- CPS Compositive io iow- PRD Predicative i\u00f6 i\u00f6w- MED Mediative ua uaw- APL Applicative ue uew- PUR Purposive uo uow- CSD Considerative u\u00f6 u\u00f6w- ESS Essive ea eaw- ASI Assimilative eo eow- FUN Functive e\u00f6 e\u00f6w- TFM Transformative oa oaw- REF Referential oe oew- CLA Classificative \u00f6a \u00f6aw- CNV Conductive \u00f6e \u00f6ew- IDP Interdependent \u00fca \u00fcaw- BEN Benefactive \u00fce \u00fcew- TSP Transpositive \u00fco \u00fcow- CMM Commutative a\u00ec a\u00ecw- COM Comitative e\u00ec e\u00ecw- CNJ Conjunctive o\u00ec o\u00ecw- UTL Utilitative u\u00ec u\u00ecw- ABE Abessive \u00f6\u00ec \u00f6\u00ecw- CVS Conversive \u00eb\u00ec \u00eb\u00ecw- COR Correlative au a\u00f9w- DEP Dependent eu e\u00f9w- PVS Provisional ou o\u00f9w- PTL Postulative iu i\u00f9w- CON Concessive \u00f6u \u00f6\u00f9w- VOC Vocative \u00ebu \u00eb\u00f9w- Label CASE Vc * Vc + Cz EXC Exceptive a -ay- AVR Aversive u -uy- CMP Comparative e -ey- SML Simultaneitive o -oy- ASS Assessive \u00f6 -\u00f6y- CNR Concursive i -iy- ACS Accessive \u00fc -\u00fcy- DFF Diffusive ai -auy- PER Periodic ei -euy- PRO Prolapsive ui -iuy- PCV Precursive oi -ouy- PCR Postcursive \u00e2 -\u00e2y- ELP Elapsive \u00ee -aey- ALP Allapsive \u00ea -\u00eay- INP Interpolative \u00f4 -\u00f4y- EPS Episodic \u00ebi -\u00ebuy- PRL Prolimitive \u00f6i -\u00f6uy- LIM Limitative \u00fb -\u00fby- LOC Locative ia iay- ORI Orientative ie iey- PSV Procursive io ioy- ALL Allative i\u00f6 i\u00f6y- ABL Ablative ua uay- NAV Navigative ue uey- CMP1A Comparative1A uo uoy- CMP2A Comparative2A u\u00f6 u\u00f6y- CMP3A Comparative3A ea eay- CMP4A Comparative4A eo eoy- CMP5A Comparative5A e\u00f6 e\u00f6y- CMP6A Comparative6A oa oay- CMP7A  Comparative7A  oe oey- CMP8A Comparative8A \u00f6a \u00f6ay- CMP1B Comparative1B \u00f6e \u00f6ey- CMP2B Comparative2B \u00fca \u00fcay- CMP3B Comparative3B \u00fce \u00fcey- CMP4B Comparative4B \u00fco \u00fcoy- CMP5B Comparative5B a\u00ec a\u00ecy- CMP6B Comparative6B e\u00ec e\u00ecy- CMP7B  Comparative7B  o\u00ec o\u00ecy- CMP8B Comparative8B u\u00ec u\u00ecy- CMP1C Comparative1C \u00f6\u00ec \u00f6\u00ecy- CMP2C Comparative2C \u00eb\u00ec \u00eb\u00ecy- CMP3C Comparative3C au a\u00f9y- CMP4C Comparative4C eu e\u00f9y- CMP5C Comparative5C ou o\u00f9y- CMP6C Comparative6C iu i\u00f9y- CMP7C  Comparative7C  \u00f6u \u00f6\u00f9y- CMP8C Comparative8C \u00ebu \u00eb\u00f9y- <p>* For the 48 cases in the right-hand column above: in Form 1 of a single-referent adjunct, those personal referents with falling tone shift to low tone, those with high tone shift to rising tone.</p> <p> The table above shows  Cz in its default (CSL) form.

When used in Form 3 of a single-referent personal referent adjunct, the order of the vocalic and consonantal portions of the affix are reversed.  </p> <p> </p> <p>8.1.2.4 The Collapsed Form: Form 4 of the adjunct, the collapsed form, is the same as the short form, Form 1, with the addition of a vocalic prefixes Vc2 which represents the case of a second instance of the same personal referent already indicated by the adjunct. In other words, the collapsed form is a short-cut means of representing two separate adjuncts, both of which refer to the same party, but in two different cases. Examples of such an adjunct were seen in Section 4.3.12 with the word \u00eato, a short-cut for t\u00ea + to, i.e, 1m/GEN plus 1m/ERG. </p> <p> </p> <p>8.1.2.5 Examples of Single-Referent Personal Reference  Adjuncts in Use</p> <p>     Azbal \u0161oi\u00a0 ek\u0161\u00edl.

There    is only one form of a dual-referent adjunct, shown in Table 31 below.</p> <p> Table 31: Morphological Structure        of a Dual-Referent Personal Reference Adjunct </p> <p>Form: _ ((Vw +) C2 +) V2 + CK+ Vc + (Cz + Vz (+ \u2019Cb)) </p> <p>Example: : u-h-ia-ks-ai-\u2019w\u00e9-\u2019ks</p> Where: Vw = vocalic prefix indicating the configuration of Referent 2  (see Table            32 below) C2 = consonant form           indicating the affiliation of Referent 2 (see Table 33 below) V2 = vocalic prefix            indicating case of Referent            2 (these values are the same as for Vc in Table 28 above) CK = consonant form indicating            both Referent 1 and Referent 2 [from Table 34 below] Vc = vocalic infix indicating case of Referent 1[see Table 28 above] Cz =  consonantal infix showing the affiliation of Referent 1 (see Table 29 above) Vz = vocalic suffix            showing the configuration  of Referent            1 (see Table 30 above) Cb = consonantal bias            suffix (see Table 15 in Sec.            5.11.1) Tone = Combinations            of Ref. 1&amp;2:_ falling + falling = falling, high            + high = high, falling + high = rising, high + falling = low  Stress = shows Referents 1 and 2            Essence respectively:               __penultimate = 1:NRM / 1:NRM, __ ultimate = 1:NRM / 2:RPV,                       antepenultimate = 1:RPV / 2:NRM, __preantepenultmate = 1:RPV / 2:RPV <p> Analyzing the above structure, it can be seen that the third term, V2, has the same values as Vc  for single-referent adjuncts; and  the last four terms and their values, Vc + Cz + Vz (+ \u2019Cb), are the same as for single-referent adjuncts.

combined (remember    it is the distinction between falling and high tone that expands the 22 single-consonant    referents into 44). Since all single-referent adjuncts are either of falling    or high tone, their combination proceeds as follows:</p> <p>falling + falling \u2192 falling     falling + high  \u2192 rising </p> <p>high + high \u2192 high </p> <p>high + falling \u2192 low  </p> <p>The order in which the above formulas are applied is based on the logical order of the personal referents, i.e., Referent 1 then Referent 2, not the order that associated vowels corresponding to the referents are manifested phonologically. (Many dual-referent personal reference adjuncts begin with vowels which carry morphological information for Referent 2, while the second syllable carries information for referent 1. Nevertheless, the tone on the adjunct is determined in the order of Referent 1 + Referent 2 as per Table 34 above.)</p> <p>   The four-way combination of Essence for Referent-1 and Referent-2    respectively is shown by the four available stress patterns: penultimate stress indicates NORMAL + NORMAL, ultimate stress    indicates NORMAL + REPRESENTATIVE, antepenultimate    indicates REPRESENTATIVE + NORMAL,    and preantepenultimate indicates REPRESENTATIVE + REPRESENTATIVE.    (See Section 3.5 on    Essence).</p> <p> 8.1.3.1 Special Use of Short Adjunct Form. The short form (Form 1) of    the single-referent adjunct discussed in Sec. 8.1.2 above (utilizing the abbreviated  VC  suffix from Table 28) can be used with the special dual-referent CK composite prefixes from Table 34 under the following    circumstance: to show that two different parties are governed by the same case    and participate equally with the verb, equivalent to connecting two pronouns    in English by \u2018and\u2019 as in He and I went to the store or The man looked at them and me. Examples: ksau,  <sup>/</sup>xlu.    Note in the last example <sup>/</sup>xlu how the combination of a falling-toned referent and a high-toned referent combines  to give a rising-toned adjunct.</p> <p> </p> <p>8.1.3.2 Examples of Dual-Referent Adjuncts</p> <p>     Eusp\u00e1t \u00a0_uda\u00a0 sm\u00e2\u2019ol.

This affix works with the OBVIATIVE personal referent    (see Sec. 8.1.1.7) to specifically indicate which    party is being referred to. The following is a review of this affix for all    nine degrees. By use of this affix, reference can be made immediately to any    party relevant to a discourse, even to a third party not previously mentioned. </p> -rm / -mr SWR Switch Reference &amp; Obviative Specification  Degree 1 nearest        preceding referent Degree 2 2nd to        nearest preceding referent Degree 3 3rd party        not previously mentioned Degree 4 referring        to sentence focus Degree 5 first referent        mentioned Degree 6 referring        to sentence topic Degree 7 3rd party        non-transrelative referent Degree 8  2nd order        transrelative referent Degree 9 higher        order transrelative referent <p>This suffix rarely appears in fifth-degree, as use of the OBVIATIVE by itself defaults to the first referent mentioned.

As previously discussed in Sec. 8.1.1, there are 22 single consonants associated with   44 single-referent personal reference categories (based on a distinction between   falling and high tone). In the absence of any other VxC suffixes to the formative, these 22 consonants can be combined with Type 3 vocalic   infix patterns (see Sec.   7.2) to correspond to certain Associative and Appositive noun cases, to create short-cut substitutes for single-referent personal reference adjuncts in these nine cases. These 22 consonants correspond to the falling-toned group of personal reference affixes; this short-cut option is not available for the 22 high-toned personal reference categories. The use of these   suffixes is optional. The noun cases associated with the nine suffix   degrees are as follows:</p> Degree 1 POSSESSIVE Case Degree 2 PROPRIETIVE Case Degree 3 GENITIVE Case Degree 4 ATTRIBUTIVE Case Degree 5 ORIGINATIVE Case  Degree 6 PRODUCTIVE Case Degree 7 INTERPRETATIVE Case Degree 8  CORRELATIVE Case Degree 9 CONDUCTIVE Case <p> </p> <p> </p> 8.2 ASPECTUAL ADJUNCTS <p> As we saw in Section 6.3.1 and Section 5.10, Aspect can be shown as the Vs suffix to a verbal adjunct, in addition to the its more usual position as a consonantal affix Cs to a formative or verbal adjunct. However, in the absence of any verbal adjunct, and as another alternative to infixing Cs within a formative, Aspect can also be conveyed by simply using the Vs affix as its own autonomous adjunct.</p> <p>Examples (compare these to the examples in Sec. 5.10.33):</p> <p> Ou\u00a0  inyat\u00a0 eq\u0163ulisqa\u00a0  t\u00ea.

Additionally, since affix categories represent common concepts generally    applicable to many contexts, an affixual adjunct can also be informally used    as a \u201cshort cut\u201d method of conveying a notion, essentially as an    abbreviated one-word sentence somewhat like an interjection or exclamation in    English, thus conveying the concept of the affix category. For example, the    affix -V1j/7 connotes disappointing typicality, but as an affixual adjunct, oj,    it can be used by itself as an informal expression translatable by the English    phrase How typical!</p> Example: <p> \u00c7tar-ryo\u00a0 igralei\u0163rar\u00a0  eglul\u00f4n. \u2192 Ar  \u00e7tar-ryo\u00a0 eir\u0163 igral\u00a0  eglul\u00f4n.

And in Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, we saw how the conjunct    form of a single-referent personal reference adjunct, as well as dual-reference personal reference adjuncts, can take an optional affix, Cb,    to indicate Bias.  In the absence of these    possibilities, the Bias suffix (shown in Table 15 of Sec. 5.11.1), like affixual adjuncts described above in Section 8.3, can stand alone as an autonomous adjunct. Such a Bias adjunct can be used to informally convey one\u2019s attitude toward    a situation. For example, if one wishes to convey a sense of awe, one could    state the Ithkuil equivalent to the sentence, I feel a sense of awe! or one can simply hiss out a long s-sound, \u2018ss,\u2019    which is the intensive form of the affix for the STUPEFACTIVE bias category, whose translation can be approximated by the English expressions    \u2018Well, I\u2019ll be!\u2019 or \u2018Who would\u2019ve thought?!\u2019</p> <p>Other examples would be the expression \u2018\u00e7\u00e7\u2019 to signify fulfillment and contentment, the equivalent to a long sigh of satisfaction    \u2018ahhh\u2019 in English; or the expression  \u2018k\u0161\u0161\u2019 to convey contempt and disgust, similar to English \u2018Poppycock!\u2019    or \u2018What bullshit!\u2019</p> <p> </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"9/","title":"9 Syntax","text":"A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Chapter 9: Syntax <p>   Syntax refers to the rules for sequencing the order of words    within a phrase or sentence, including rules permitting more than one possible    sequential ordering of words. To understand the following discussion of Ithkuil    syntax it is necessary to have a cursory understanding of the notions of semantic      role, pragmatic role, and grammatical (or syntactical) relations:</p> <ul> <li>Semantic role: This refers to the underlying semantic        function of a particular word, irrespective of overt morphological category.        We have already seen how Ithkuil marks its noun cases to reflect semantic        roles, not grammatical relations. Such roles include Agent, Patient, Experiencer,        Recipient, Instrument, etc., as previously explained in Section      4.1 et seq. </li> <li>Pragmatic role: This refers to the function of a word        or phrase in relation to its predicate or the rest of the sentence in terms        of whether and how it represents \u201cgiven\u201d versus \u201cnew\u201d        information, i.e., whether or not the word or phrase represents background        information already known to the addressee, or whether it represents new        information previously unknown to the addressee. Three such roles or relations        are generally delineated: topic, comment,        and focus. The topic of a sentence is the word        or phrase about which the speaker has been asked or is expected by the addressee        to talk about. The comment is the information (usually a predicate)        given by the speaker about the particular topic. The term focus refers to whatever information in a sentence is new to the addressee, (i.e.,        not previously known).  To illustrate these concepts, consider the sentence I can see            why Mary\u2019s angry, but what about Bill? (i.e., What happened              to make Bill angry, too?). In the hypothetical answer Bill (or                He) is angry because he lost his keys, \u2018Bill\u2019 (or \u2018he\u2019)        is the topic, \u2018is angry because he lost his keys\u2019 is the comment,        and \u2018he lost his keys\u2019 is the focus. </li> <li>Grammatical (or syntactical) relations: the arbitrary word-ordering rules of a language, irrespective        of semantic or pragmatic roles, e.g., the subject of the sentence in English        normally precedes the main verb and the direct object normally follows the        main verb.</li> </ul> <p>In general, the syntax of a language either (1) establishes    the permissible grammatical relations of the language, (2) reflects and/or reinforces    semantic roles, (3) reflects and/or reinforces pragmatic roles, or (4) any combination    of these. As one might surmise from the above, English syntax is weighted heavily    toward establishing grammatical relations at the near-total expense of identifying    semantic roles. As for pragmatic roles, English rarely reflects these in its    syntax (one exception is the strong tendency for placing wh- question    words in sentence-initial position in specialized questions, even if they represent    a direct object, e.g., What have you done? or Who[m] are they talking      about?), however, such roles do tend to be marked \u201csupra-segmentally\u201d    by inflection of vocal pitch and tone of voice. </p> <p>We have already seen the extreme to which Ithkuil uses noun cases to mark semantic    roles morphologically as opposed to syntactically. And since grammatial relations    in and of themselves are relatively arbitrary within language, Ithkuil uses     word order primarily to accomplish pragmatic relations, i.e., to indicate the topic and/or focus of a sentence. Additionally, Ithkuil does have a few word order constraints  necessary to ensure avoidance    of ambiguity in determining which     nouns lie in apposition to their head, and which words of a compound sentence    lie within a case-frame as opposed to outside the case-frame. The specifics of Ithkuil word order are explained in Section 9.1 below.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 9.1 TOPIC, FOCUS, AND PRAGMATIC RELATIONS <p>The concept of semantic focus refers to what    information in an utterance is to be considered new information, while the semantic topic is the   background context already known or implied. The specifics are explained below and are best understood  through various English illustrations.</p> <p>In any given discourse (i.e., a contextual series of utterances    such as a conversation, a story, an account of an event, etc.), any single sentence    of that discourse will likely make reference to previously mentioned material    as background, as well as present new material to further the purpose of the    discourse. Semantic focus refers to those elements of a sentence which constitute    new material within an actual or implied discourse. For example, the sentence My dog jumps through hoops could function as an answer to several different    questions such as 1) What tricks can your dog do?, or 2) Does your      dog do anything with hoops? or 3) Do you know of anyone\u2019s pet        that jumps through hoops? or even 4) What\u2019s up with you? In answering the first of these questions, \u2018jump through hoops\u2019    would have semantic focus while the dog is background material, i.e. the topic. In answering    the second question, the verbal phrase \u2018jump through\u2019 would have    focus while both the dog and the hoops would be the topic. In answering    the third question, it would be \u2018my dog\u2019 that carries the focus    while jumping through hoops would be the topic. Lastly, in answering the    fourth sentence, no element in the sentence has focus over any other, as all    elements present previously unknown material within the context of the discourse.    In general, English conveys focus by a shift in vocal inflection (tone and pitch    contours) to provide emphasis.</p> <p>Focus does not necessarily require a full discourse to have    semantic relevance; it can occur within a single autonomous sentence, in which    case the background discourse is implied. For example, a person might spontaneously    begin a conversation with the same sentence: My dog jumps through hoops. In    English, the speaker might use vocal inflection to emphasize what elements convey    semantic focus versus what elements are to be taken by the listener as \u201cgiven.\u201d    Or, the speaker might say the sentence in a neutral tone of voice, essentially    inviting the listener to \u201cchoose\u201d which elements to focus upon in    responding, e.g., Oh, you have a dog? or Oh, does he do any other      tricks? or Oh, do you use metal or plastic hoops? or an equally    neutral response such as Oh, you don\u2019t say?</p> <p>Ithkuil uses word-order to  accomplish the same options    that such vocal inflections accomplish in English. In Ithkuil, the element with focus is placed immediately before the verb.  As for the topic of the sentence, this is shown by placing it as the first element in a sentence. If there is no overt topic or focus, the verb will appear as the first word in the sentence. Examples: </p> <p>      Euspoigrata\u00ec\u00a0   ek\u0161\u00fal\u00a0 b\u0159at\u013c.

(The clams are the topic; the clown is the focus) </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 9.1.1 Abbreviated Sentences Using Focus and Topicalization <p>Focus and topicalization allow Ithkuil, as with other languages,    to provide abbreviated sentences in direct answer to commands,  questions,    or to comment on a topic already under discussion. Because the topic is already    known within the contextual discourse, only the portion of the new sentence    carrying semantic focus need be spoken. Similarly, the topicalization      suffix in conjunction with the INTERROGATIVE illocution, allows for abbreviated inquiries within a known contextual    discourse, similar to such abbreviated sentences in English, e.g., \u2018and    Bill?\u2019 in lieu of the full sentence \u2018Comment on how this applies    to Bill.\u2019</p> <p> </p> 9.1.2 Word-order within Case-Frames <p>Within a case-frame (see Section    5.4), the verb always appears in initial position to identify the clause    as a case frame (using FRAMED Relation in the verb). Because of this, it becomes necessary to utilize the focusing and sequencing affixes from Sec. 7.4.13 to identify elements which carry focus or are topicalized within the case-frame. Additionally, the last noun within the case-frame    will usually take the -Vt\u2019 in degree 2, 6, 7, or 9 (see Sec. 7.4.13)    to signify the end of the case-frame, unless this is clear without the suffix    (e.g., because the case-frame is in sentence-final position). </p> <p> </p> 9.1.3 Additional Constraints in Word Order <p>The following additional word-order constraints exist    in order to avoid potential ambiguity or semantic incoherence.</p> <ul> <li> Nouns in Possessive and Associative cases (see Secs.        4.4 and 4.5)        which are dependent on, or in apposition to a \u201chead\u201d noun, must        immediately precede or follow that head noun, unless the relationship between the two nouns is otherwise clear from context or other morphological elements. </li> <li> A case-frame cannot be broken apart into segments within a main sentence,        i.e., the case-frame must constitute a single cohesive clause and not contain        elements of the main clause within it. It is possible to \u201cnest\u201d        a second case-frame within a case-frame, similar to the way in which subordinate        or relative clauses can be nested in English and other Western languages,        e.g., [Despite owning a Picasso [that comes from his Blue period] [of          which I, [a mere student,] am fond,]] Joe is actually a very humble person. </li> </ul> <p> </p>  9.1.4 Phonotactically-Induced Syntactic Modifications  <p>As mentioned above, word-order can shift in an Ithkuil sentence    to accommodate phonotactic or phonaesthetic ends, i.e., for purposes of euphony.    This is because suffixes on a formative, as well as morphemes associated with    categories of Aspect and Bias can be moved to verbal adjuncts or transformed into autonomous adjuncts (see Sections 6.3, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4). As     words    of six syllables or more are generally undesirable,  any formative    with numerous affixes is potentially subject to having several of its morphemes    redistributed to adjuncts. </p> <p>Example: </p> <p> Ar-ryigrawilei\u0163rar\u00a0  eglul\u00f4n. \u2192 \u00c7tar-rya\u00a0 eir\u0163 igralar\u00a0  eglul\u00f4n.

Generally, this means that they will be adjacent to the formative, or    occur on either side of other adjuncts associated with the formative.</p>    9.1.5 Iconicity  <p>English and other languages generally display phrase-structure    patterns and word-order patterns which reinforce, or even reflect, a cognitive    understanding of what is being described, i.e., the order of the words themselves    reflects information about how we are to understand the utterance. Such a phenomenon    is known as iconicity. In English and other Western languages,    the most common way in which iconicity is manifested is what is termed \u201csequential    order iconicity,\u201d the idea that the actual sequential order of words in    a phrase or sentence reflects the sequential order of the events they describe.    For example, the phrases \u2018eye it, try it, buy it,\u2019 \u2018I came,    I saw, I conquered,\u2019 or \u2018dine and dash\u2019 describe sequential    events where the sequence of the words reflect the sequence of the events. What    is most important is that re-ordering of the words either changes the meaning    of the phrase or leads to semantic nonsense, e.g., \u2018buy it, eye it, try    it\u2019 implies that a different sequence of events actually takes place than    \u2018eye it, try it, buy it.\u2019 This can be more dramatically illustrated    with the following pair of sentences.</p> <p>1) Jane got married and had a baby.     2) Jane had a baby and got married.</p> <p>In English, the ambiguous word \u2018and\u2019 is interpreted    as connecting a sequence of events, i.e., \u2018and\u2019 is interpreted to    mean sequential \u2018then\u2019 (= \u2018and following that,\u2019 \u2018then    next\u2019 or \u2018then later\u2019). As a result, the meanings of the two    sentences imply very different social interpretations about Jane.</p> <p>Besides the reflection of sequential order, other types of    word-order iconicity are possible. For example, compare the subtle difference    in meaning between the following two sentences:</p> <p>3) Sam painted the fence white.     4) Sam painted the white fence.</p> <p>In the first sentence, we do not know what color the fence    was prior to being painted, or even if it was a new fence that had never been    painted before. In the second sentence, not only do we know what color the fence    had been, but also that it was not previously unpainted, however, we do not    necessarily know what its new color is. This sort of iconicity is used to convey    a resultative state of affairs, i.e., by placing the adjective \u2018white\u2019    after the word \u2018fence\u2019 (seemingly in violation of the usual adjective-before-noun    word order used in English), we describe a resulting state of affairs.</p> <p>Yet another type of word-order iconicity is displayed in comparing    the following two sentences.</p> <p>5) Loretta gave Sue a wedding gift.     6) Loretta gave a wedding gift to Sue.</p> <p>Most grammar textbooks would state that these two sentences    are semantically equivalent, the first employing a \u201cditransitive\u201d    pattern (i.e., juxtaposing an indirect object \u2018Sue\u2019 with a direct    object \u2018wedding gift\u2019), while the second uses a \u201ccomplement\u201d    pattern in which the indirect object follows the direct object and is changed    to a prepositional phrase using \u2018to.\u2019 However, there is a subtle    semantic distinction between the two sentences. The first strongly implies that    the wedding gift is for Sue, i.e., Sue is the bride and intended recipient.    The second sentence, however, invites the possibility that Sue is only a temporary    or circumstantial goal for the act of giving, but not the bride and intended    recipient. For example, if Sue is merely a guest at the wedding and Loretta    needed Sue\u2019s help carrying an armload of wedding gifts, she might give    a wedding gift to Sue, but that does not mean she would give Sue a wedding gift. This type of iconicity distinguishing a recipient from a directional    goal is an example of what is termed \u201cdistance iconicity,\u201d because    the two linked words are made more \u201cdistant\u201d from each other in    the sentence as a reflection of their more circumstantial association.</p> <p>Ithkuil does not display iconicity. While the order of words    in an Ithkuil phrase or sentence may coincidentally reflect a temporal or causative    sequence of events, this is not by syntactic design. Because of the myriad means    available in Ithkuil to morphologically distinguish sequence, cause-and-effect,    resulting states, and the distinction of recipients from directional goals,    no iconicity patterns are required.</p> <p>For example, we saw in sentences (1) and (2) above how English    \u2018and\u2019 can be used to convey not just mere coordination, but also    a sequencing function. In Sections      7.4.3 and 7.4.4, we saw    that Ithkuil has no less than thirty-six suffixes (four suffix categories, each    with nine different degrees) which convey various coordinative and sequencing    patterns with great specificity. Thus, Ithkuil has no morpheme directly equivalent    to the ambiguous English word \u2018and.\u2019 There is an affix corresponding    to \u2018and\u2019 in its use as a mere additive listing device (e.g., \u2018pears    and apples and bananas\u2019), another corresponding to its use as an indicator    of simultaneity (e.g., I clenched my fists and scowled), another    corresponding to its use as an indicator of additional information (e.g., The    clown likes children and loves to eat), another to its use as an indicator    of parallel description or activity (e.g., We went dancing and so did    they), and yet another as a temporal sequencing indicator (e.g., I  went to the window and looked out).</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> 9.2 MORPHO-SEMANTIC CONSIDERATIONS <p>It should be noted that when structuring an Ithkuil sentence,    particularly when translating from other languages such as English, care must    be given to avoid capturing irrelevant semantic information reflected by the    morphology of the source language and trying to find an equivalent or parallel    way to reflect those irrelevancies in the Ithkuil sentence. This can have a    profound effect on the morpho-syntactical structure of the resulting Ithkuil    sentence.</p> <p> </p> 9.2.1 Arbitrary Delineations of Perspective or Point of View <p>One area where word-choice in English and other Western languages    arbitrarily affects sentence structure is in the unintentional schematicization    of a particular perspective or point of view. For example, consider the following    pair of sentences in English.</p> <p>1) The path climbs steeply out of the canyon.     2) The path descends steeply into the canyon.</p> <p>Both of these sentences are describing the same property of    the path \u2014 its steepness. The distinction in the sentences comes from    the point of view being reflected by the speaker. In sentence (1) the implied    point of view is from the bottom of the canyon upward, while in sentence (2)    the viewpoint is from the top of the canyon downward. What is important is that,    semantically, the point of view is of no relevance to the steepness of the path per se. So if the cognitive intent of the utterance is simply to describe    the vertical gradient of the path within the canyon, there would be only one    Ithkuil translation for both of these sentences, eschewing the point of view    entirely and restating the sentence to read: </p> <p> \u00dbb \u00a0eikkradwa \u00a0smou\u2019ol\u00e2xh.

LISTEN </p> <p> </p> 9.2.2 Masking of Semantic or Participatory Roles <p>Similarly, care must be made, when comparing Ithkuil sentence    structure with other languages, to note that Ithkuil grammar allows for a more    overt reflection of the underlying semantic roles inherent in a given sentence.    As a result, sentence structures in Western languages which \u201cmask\u201d    potentially anomalous semantic structures are avoided in Ithkuil. For example,    compare the following pairs of sentences.</p> 3a) He supplied a report to the analyst. 4a) She applied a solvent to the stain. 3b) He supplied the analyst a report. 4b) *She applied the stain a solvent. <p>The syntactical patterns of these two pairs of sentences are    identical, yet the word-order in sentence (4b) is ungrammatical (as indicated    by the asterisk), while the same word-order in sentence (3b) presents no problem.    The underlying reason for the difference is one of semantic role. While \u2018analysts\u2019    can function in the role of Recipients, \u2018stains\u2019 cannot (they are    merely directional Goals, i.e., where the solvent gets applied). Cognitively,    stains cannot \u201cpossess\u201d a solvent the way analysts can \u201cpossess\u201d    a report. In Ithkuil, the semantic roles would be clearly defined by the case-markings    of the participants. Therefore, syntactically inconsistent pairs such as (3b)    and (4b) do not occur.</p> <p>Sometimes, rather than semantic role, it is a participant\u2019s    relationship to an underlying clause that presents the problem. For example, He\u2019s a tall president means \u2018He\u2019s a president who    is tall.\u2019 So why doesn\u2019t He\u2019s a likely president mean \u2018*He\u2019s a president who is likely\u2019? The reason is that,    while \u2018tall\u2019 describes its adjacent referent \u2018president,\u2019    \u2018likely\u2019 does not describe its adjacent referent. Rather, \u2018likely\u2019    describes an underlying process in which that referent is or will be engaged,    i.e., \u2018running for president.\u2019 Therefore, while these two sentences    are morpho-syntactically identical in English, their Ithkuil translations are    quite different from one another morpho-syntactically:  </p> <p> </p> <p>     Qi \u00a0alka\u0163eins\u00a0 e\u00e1drai\u2019seumi. ma-AFF\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STA-\u2018height\u2019-NRM/DEL/N/CSL/UNI-PTT<sub>2</sub>/6-IFL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MNF-FRAMED/FML-\u2018preside/govern\u2019-COR-NRM/PRX/M/CSL/UNI-ROL<sub>2</sub>/4-FNC He\u2019s a tall president.

Consider the English    sentence Shelly doesn\u2019t think they like her cooking. Note this    sentence does not mean what a literal word-for-word analysis implies, i.e.,    \u2018That they like her cooking is not something that Shelly is thinking.\u2019    Rather, the correct meaning is \u2018Shelly thinks that they don\u2019t like    her cooking.\u2019 Ithkuil is very precise in specifying exactly what components    of a sentence are to be negated. Use of the four affirmation/negation affixes    from Section 7.4.9  in conjunction with a formative carries very specific information as to what    morphological components of a sentence are being affirmed or negated and to    what degree. Using these four affixes alone, Ithkuil can distinguish between    the following four sentences without any syntactic rearrangement of the words:</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to begin singing.</p> <p>I\u2019m beginning to not want to sing.</p> <p>I want to not begin singing.</p> <p>I\u2019m beginning to want to not sing.</p> <p>Thus when translating negative sentences into Ithkuil, care    must be taken to not syntactically \u201crearrange\u201d a sentence as with Shelly doesn\u2019t think they like her cooking. Additionally, Ithkuil    makes a morpho-semantic distinction not found in Western languages: the difference    between absolute negation and relative negation.    Absolute negation implies that the non-existence or non-occurrence of an entity,    state, or event is due to contextual inapplicability, while relative negation    indicates that the non-existence or non-occurrence is circumstantial. This distinction    is illustrated in the two sentences below:</p> <p> Ilma\u0163\u00e1r \u00eaqeil. DYN-\u2018sing\u2019-NRM/DEL/N/CSL/UNI-NA1<sub>1</sub>/5-FML\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STA-\u2018girl\u2019-ACT-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL The woman doesn\u2019t sing [even though she can, i.e., she chooses      not to].</p> <p> </p> <p>     Ilm\u00e0\u0163\u00eer \u00eaqeil. DYN-\u2018sing\u2019-NRM/DEL/N/CSL/UNI-NA1<sub>1<sub><sub></sub></sub></sub>/4-FML\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STA-\u2018girl\u2019-ACT-NRM/DEL/M/CSL/UNI-IFL The woman doesn\u2019t sing [because she can\u2019t, i.e., she is      mute].</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> 9.3 THE \u201cCARRIER\u201d      ROOT <p>Since the Ithkuil declensional and conjugational system is    based on  multiple  patterns of vowel mutation, affixation, and shifts in tone and stress, proper    nouns such as personal and place names, as well as non-Ithkuil words from other    languages are by nature morpho-phonologically incompatible with such as system.    Nevertheless, such words can be declined or conjugated like any other Ithkuil    formative by means of the \u201ccarrier\u201d root -p-.    In addition to this use, the carrier root is employed in certain other contexts    as well, as described below.</p>    9.3.1 Words that Cannot Take Affixes or Be Mutated <p>The three primary stems of the carrier root, (a)p-, ep-, up-, are respectively associated with animate    beings (the two complementary derivatives op- and \u00e2p- being humans versus non-humans or    figuratively/metaphorically animate entities); inanimate entities (the two complementary    derivatives \u00f6p- and \u00eap- being objectively concrete entities versus subjective entities such    as thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.); and finally intangible abstract referents    (the two complementary derivatives  \u00eep-/\u00fbp- and \u00f4p- being place names and abstractions). The    carrier stem is placed immediately before the proper noun or foreign word or    phrase, then declined or conjugated normally for any desired morphological categories,    even verbal categories. The proper noun or foreign word or phrase itself is  left unchanged. The non-Ithkuil word or phrase is pronounced with either high or rising tone on its last syllable, in order to clue the listener that the following syllable/word returns to being Ithkuil. For those rare instances where the non-Ithkuil word or phrase natively carries grammatical tone (e.g., properly pronounced Cantonese), the end of the phrase can be indicated by either a pause in speech or repetition of the carrier-stem following the phrase. (Note: this repeated carrier-stem would not be indicated in writing - see Sec. 11.4.)</p> <p> </p>  9.3.2 Emphasizing or Highlighting a Particular Category <p>Another use of the carrier root is to emphasize or topicalize    a particular affix or grammatical element associated with a word. For example,    in English we can say \u2018a big house\u2019 with extra intonation    on the word \u2018big\u2019 to emphasize that word. To accomplish such emphasis    in Ithkuil, the carrier root is used with the augmentative suffix in conjunction    with the noun \u2018house\u2019 as opposed to simply using the augmentative    suffix on the stem for \u2018house.\u2019 No change in vocal pitch or intonation    is required, as the grammatically unnecessary use of the carrier root serves    to accomplish the required emphasis. Any morphological category manifested by    a carrier root rather than an adjunct or mutation serves to emphasize that category.    (It should be noted that the use of optional combination and euphonic adjuncts    do not accomplish such emphasis. Their use versus non-use imparts no difference    in emphasis for the particular morphological categories contained in the adjunct.)  </p>  9.3.3 Titles of Address <p>It should be noted that the use of the carrier root in front    of the names of persons serves to function as a title of address corresponding    to English Mister, Ms. or Miss. There is no distinction of    gender or marital status conveyed by the term. </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"abbr/","title":"Abbreviations","text":"A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language - Abbreviations List

This represents approximately one-fourth of the roots in the language. Additional roots and their stems will be periodically added  to this list as time permits.</p> <p>(NOTE: The above \"Supplement to Lexicon\" link presents a PDF file of approximately 85 additional lexical roots and their associated stems.)</p> <p>The reader should be aware that the glosses (i.e., the English translations    or definitions) for each of the stems below are at times somewhat arbitrary,    as Ithkuil roots and their stems have been conceptualized from the cognitive    level up, without regard as to whether they correspond necessarily to an existing    word or phrase in English or other languages. As a result, some of the English    glosses chosen as representations for the Ithkuil stems are approximations at    best. </p> <p>Ideally, the best way to represent the meanings of Ithkuil stems would be to    use a semantic \u201cmeta-language\u201d comprised of a closed set of semantically    universal (or near-universal) \u201cprimitives\u201d to create semantic \u201cformulas\u201d    which define the use of a particular stem. (The design and use of such a meta-language    to translate the meanings of words from one language to another can be found    in the writings of linguist Anna Wierzbicka.) However, the author has chosen    not to pursue such an effort for the sake of time, as such an analysis would likely take decades to complete.</p> <p>In regard to the list below, note that in some cases both a nominal (i.e.,    noun) and verbal gloss have been provided, while in others only one or the other    is present. Nevertheless, the reader should keep in mind at all times that Ithkuil    stems always convey both a nominal and verbal meaning, as explained in detail    in Section 2.4.1.</p> <p>The lexicon is arranged in the following alphabetical order:</p> <p>B C C\u2019 C<sup>h</sup>  \u00c7 \u010c \u010c\u2019 \u010c<sup>h</sup> D Dh F G J K K\u2019 K<sup>h</sup> L \u013b M N  \u0147 P P\u2019 P<sup>h</sup> Q Q\u2019 Q<sup>h</sup> R \u0158 S \u0160 T T\u2019 T<sup>h</sup> \u0162 V X Xh Z \u017b \u017d</p> <p></p> <p>It should also be noted that in  previous versions of the language, formative roots were divided into lexico-semantic \u201cclasses\u201d designated by the phonological patterning of the root (there were 17 such classes in the original version of Ithkuil, ten such classes in Ilaksh). In the current version of the language, these lexico-semantic classes have been eliminated, as the author has realized that the establishment of such classes does not serve any  functional purpose in \u201creal-world\u201d spoken/written contexts; the ability to identify the semantic class of a stem does not sufficiently aid in understanding the stem\u2019s specific meaning. Therefore, the  assignment of phoneme patterns to roots in Ithkuil is now arbitrary.  While the astute reader will  note that many roots pertaining to a specific semantic notion (e.g., animals, plant and substance taxonomies, spatial position, etc.) still have similar phonological patterning, such patterning is nevertheless merely incidental and is without formal significance.</p> <p> </p> Note on Ithkuil's Implicit \u201cTheory of Meaning\u201d <p>For those readers who may be trained in linguistics, particulary cognitive linguistics, it should be noted that at this point in the author\u2019s development of the language, a traditional Enlightenment-based theory of meaning, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between a lexeme and its external \u201cin-the-world\u201d referent, has been implicitly assumed for convenience and/or expediency\u2019s sake. A more careful and rigourous construction for Ithkuil\u2019s lexico-semantics, given the author\u2019s stated design goals (as described in the Introduction section), would not assume such a theory of meaning, but would rather incorporate more recent findings of cognitive science and cognitive linguistics to reflect embodied meaning and metaphor-based conceptualization. However, pursuing such a foundation for the lexico-semantics of the language would, in the author\u2019s opinion, be extremely time-consuming (on the order of many additional years, perhaps decades, to construct). Rather than withdraw the language from public availability for such reasons, the author has chosen instead to adopt a traditional/formalist foundation for its lexico-semantics essentially out of convenience, in order to be able to showcase the language's morphology. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The Lexicon: </p> <p> </p> <p>-B-\u00a0 \u2018WANT/DESIRE/REQUEST\u2019</p> <p>INFORMAL Stems</p> <p>FORMAL Stems</p> <p>1. affective (i.e., unwilled) want/desire [emotion +    object of desire]</p> <p>1. request [desire + thing requested]</p> <p>2. conscious desire based on need/lack/goal</p> <p>2. need/lack/necessity + thing needed or lacking</p> <p>3. hope/wish [feeling + thing wished/hoped for]</p> <p>3. ambition/goal/aspiration;

LISTEN </p> <p> </p> <p></p> The Opening Line from Anna Kerenina <p>The following narrative presents the step-by-step  procedure undertaken by the author in translating the opening line of Tolstoy\u2019s  Anna Karenina into  Ithkuil. It should be noted that I have used the English translation of the sentence instead of the Russian  original as my translation source:</p> <p>All  happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own  way.</p> <p> STEP ONE:  Semantic Analysis of Source Sentence    Before  beginning translation, it is important to carefully analyze the actual meaning  of the sentence from a cognitive    standpoint,  i.e., what is the cognitive intent of the sentence as opposed to how it reads  stylistically? This is    important  because Ithkuil must convey the underlying cognitive intent of the sentence. In  this sentence, one might    initially  interpret the sentence to suggest that there are two different kinds of  families, one happy, the other unhappy,    and  that happy ones can\u2019t ever be unhappy or vice-versa. But in fact, all families  are capable of being happy or    unhappy.  Therefore, the Ithkuil translation will reword the sentence to convey that when  families are happy, they    resemble  one another, whereas when they are unhappy they don\u2019t resemble one another.  Secondly, we must analyze    what  is meant by the word \u2018resemble\u2019. In English, \u2018resemble\u2019 refers to similarity in  visual appearance or observed    behavior.  However, the intent of the sentence is that the similarity of behavior is  intrinsic and occurs whether or not    there  is anyone available to visually observe it. Therefore, the Ithkuil translation  must avoid use of any concept such    as  \u2018resemble\u2019 to imply visual observation of behavior. The behavior simply is similar or dissimilar, regardless of    whether  there is any visual comparison made. The Ithkuil translation will therefore  simply distinguish between    similarity  in the manifestation/behavior of happiness in families versus dissimilarity in  the manifestation/behavior of    unhappiness  in families. Finally, in the original sentence, the second clause is  syntactically disguised as a co-equal main  clause, however, cognitively it is a dependent clause in a contingent  relationship to the first half of the    sentence.  The \u201cmissing\u201d conjunction should be \u2018whereas\u2019 or \u2018as opposed to\u2019 or \u2018while on  the other hand\u2019 since it is  being  contrastively compared to the first clause. Ithkuil provides a case-frame (the COMPARATIVE)  for exactly these kinds  of contrastive comparisons. Therefore the Ithkuil sentence will employ such a  case-frame when translating the second  half of the sentence. So at this point, what we will be translating into  Ithkuil reads something like \u201cAll families  manifest happiness similarly, whereas they manifest unhappiness dissimilarly.\u201d</p> <p>   STEP TWO:  Separating the Lexical from the Morphological    At  this point, the original sentence must be analyzed to determine what Ithkuil  lexical roots/stems will be necessary,    as  opposed to those words/concepts in the original which can be translated via  morphological components instead of    lexical  roots/stems. We can see we are making a statement about families and are  qualifying those families as happy    or  unhappy. Therefore it is likely we will need Ithkuil lexemes for \u2018family\u2019 and \u2018happy/happiness.\u2019  We have    already  determined above that we do not need a word for \u2018resemble\u2019 and words like \u2018all\u2019,  \u2018one another\u2019, \u2018each\u2019, \u2018in    its  own way\u2019 carry little intrinsic meaning by themselves until they are used in  conjunction with the main    participants  (nouns and verbs) of the sentence. We know from studying Ithkuil morphology  that all of these words  will  be handled by morphological, not lexical means when translating. Therefore, we  only need two main lexemes: \u2018family\u2019  and \u2018happy/happiness.\u2019</p> <p> STEP THREE:  Analysis/Derivation Using Ithkuil Morphological Categories    Those  who have studied the Configuration and Affiliation categories of Ithkuil  morphology might recognize at this    point  that the concept \u2018family\u2019 is a composite sort of concept, indicating an entity  composed of sub-components or    sub-members,  each one of whom is a \u2018family member.\u2019 Ithkuil tends not to lexify as discrete  stems those words that    are  gestalt entities comprised of sub-components. Rather it is the sub-components  that are lexified into stems and    then  morphologically modified via the various Configuration and Affiliation  categories. The Ithkuil lexicon    contains  the Pattern 1, Stem 1, INFORMAL stem amm meaning a nuclear family member, derived from  the root -MM-  referring to the various    sanguine  members of a nuclear family (parent, child, mother, father, son, daughter,  etc.). A family consists of    various  such members, each of whom are not identical in their attributes (e.g., gender,  age, personality, talents, etc.).     A  gestalt composite composed of non-identical members who are not physically  interconnected, is shown by the    AGGREGATE  [AGG] configuration in Ithkuil. Likewise, the resulting gestalt  entity \u2018family\u2019 is more than the sum of    its  parts from a cognitive standpoint (i.e., it is capable of participating in  events or being described in ways    irrespective  of its individual members), therefore it should be placed in the COALESCENT  [COA] affiliation. Finally,    the  particular sentence being translated talks about families in a timeless  cultural sense, describing families in an    archetypal  fashion. Such a sense can best be captured by use of the AMALGAMATE  [AMG] context in Ithkuil. So far,    the  Ithkuil word for \u2018family\u2019 we are fashioning has been declined for  Configuration, Affiliation, and Context.    However,  there are five remaining morphological categories for nominal formatives in  Ithkuil. We must consider  each  of these:</p> <p> PERSPECTIVE:  The sentence is comparing every family against every other family, thus it is  speaking of each      family  as a single discrete entity, not a collective concept. This is reinforced by  the use of the word \u2018all\u2019 (which in      the  Ithkuil translation will appear as the Inclusive suffix [INL] in ninth degree,  meaning \u2018each/every\u2019). Thus the      correct  perspective is the default MONADIC perspective.</p> <p>EXTENSION:  Each family is being considered as an entire discrete entity within the context  of the sentence,      therefore  the default DELIMITIVE extension is  appropriate.</p> <p>DESIGNATION:  The stem amm is in the default INFORMAL  designation, as indicated by its syllabic stress pattern (recall from Section 1.3.3 that all monosyllabic stems are considered to have penultimate stress from a morphological standpoint).</p> <p>ESSENCE:  The sentence refers to all families in the real world, not families in a  hypothetical or contrary-to-fact      context,  therefore the default NORMAL essence is  appropriate.</p> <p>CASE:  The word \u2018family\u2019 will be the \u201csubject\u201d of a verb complex meaning \u2018manifests  happy behavior\u2019. The      appropriate  semantic role for the subject of a non-causal descriptive state is as CONTENT,  shown by the default      OBLIQUE  [OBL]case in Ithkuil.</p> <p>   The  concept \u2018happy/happiness\u2019 is given in Ithkuil by the Pattern 1, Stem 2, FORMAL stem \u00f6qt\u00e1 which literally means \u2018degree  of happiness/joy\u2019.     This  stem is derived from the root -QT- \u2018DEGREE OF POSITIVE  EMOTIONAL SATIETY/FULFILLMENT\u2019.  Qualitative    concepts  such as happiness are usually lexified in Ithkuil as a spectrum or range which  then takes the Sufficiency    [SUF]  or Extent/Degree [EXN] suffix to indicate what particular amount/extent/degree  of the quality is manifested,    anywhere  from none up to an overabundance. In this case, we will use the [EXN1/6]  suffix indicating \u2018an above-normal    degree  of\u2019. Adjectives such as \u2018happy\u2019 don\u2019t exist in Ithkuil; their equivalent is  usually shown using a verbal    formative  declined into either the STATIVE [STA] function or  the DESCRIPTIVE [DSC] function. The choice    between  using STATIVE or DESCRIPTIVE function  for this translation is subtle. I have chosen [DSC] because it    captures  more of the sense of describing the nature of the family itself (which is what  I think the author was trying to    convey)  rather than simply a state they are in. Verbal formatives are complex  structures in Ithkuil, inflecting for 22    different  morphological categories. So, besides the DSC function, the remaining 21  categories must be analyzed,  as  follows:</p> <p>     CONFIGURATION:  Conceptually, \u2018happiness\u2019 is not a gestalt composite, therefore the default UNIPLEX  value is      appropriate.</p> <p>AFFILIATION:  The UNIPLEX configuration implies a default CONSOLIDATIVE  affiliation, and the uses of the remaining three affiliations are inapplicable to the intended meaning of \u2018happiness\u2019.</p> <p>PERSPECTIVE:  The sentence is asserted as being true at all times, a \u201claw of nature\u201d about  families, therefore the      appropriate  perspective is the NOMIC [N].</p> <p>EXTENSION:  The state of happiness being discussed is not described as having specific  beginning or ending      points,  therefore the appropriate extension is PROXIMAL [PRX].</p> <p>CONTEXT:  Happiness as an emotional state exists irrespective of opinions, cultural  ideas, social conventions, etc.,      therefore,  the default EXISTENTIAL context is  appropriate.</p> <p>DESIGNATION:  The stem is in the default INFORMAL designation,  as indicated by its syllabic stress pattern.</p> <p>ESSENCE:  The sentence refers to happiness as a real-world state, not in a hypothetical  or contrary-to-fact context,      therefore  the default NORMAL essence is  appropriate.</p> <p> ILLOCUTION:  The sentence constitutes a propositional speech act, an utterance which is  either true or false and      can  be either believed or disbelieved. Thus, the default ASSERTIVE  illocution is appropriate. </p> <p>VALENCE:  The state of happiness is being compared between families, implying PARALLEL  valence (i.e., one      participant  is engaged in or experiencing the same activity or state as the other). However,  because the verbal      formative  will be carrying the [SIM1/8] suffix (meaning \u2018very  similarly\u2019), the valence relationship between one      family  and another is already implied. This means that overtly showing the PARALLEL  valence in this sentence is      unnecessary  (or at least optional). </p> <p>VERSION:  The utterance describes a non-hypothetical end-in-itself and is not  goal-oriented, therefore the default      PROCESSUAL  version is appropriate.</p> <p>FORMAT:  Their is no incorporated stem in this verb,      therefore  the showing of Format is inapplicable.</p> <p>MODALITY:  There is no modal or hypothetical content in this sentence, therefore there is  no modality.</p> <p>LEVEL:  While one might consider translating this sentence using Ithkuil\u2019s EQUATIVE  level, its use would imply      that  families manifest happiness exactly the same way (as opposed to similarly).  This is not the intent behind the      word  \u2018resemble\u2019 and therefore use of the [SIM1/8]  suffix (meaning \u2018very similarly\u2019) is more appropriate. Therefore,      the  default INDETERMINATE level is appropriate.</p> <p>CASE-FRAME:  As previously mentioned, the second clause of this sentence will employ the COMPARATIVE      [CMP]  case-frame to signify a \u201cwhereas X\u201d or \u201cas opposed to X\u201d type of relationship.</p> <p> VALIDATION:  Since the statement is not an empirically verifiable statement, but is written  as being a truthful      assertion,  the implied source of information behind the statement is as an inference on  the part of the author based      on  his own intuition or feelings. Therefore the appropriate validation is the INFERENTIAL.</p> <p>PHASE:  The statement does not refer to any repetitive or iterative situation,  therefore the default CONTEXTUAL      phase  is appropriate.</p> <p>SANCTION:  The statement constitutes an ontologically subjective assertion or allegation  expressing an opinion or      belief,  potentially subject to challenge or refutation. Therefore, the appropriate  sanction is the ALLEGATIVE [ALG].</p> <p>ASPECT:  The sentence contains no additional aspectual information.</p> <p>MOOD:  The sentence is an assertion of an alleged fact, therefore the default FACTUAL  mood is appropriate.</p> <p>BIAS:  The utterance contains no overtly subjective attitude or bias.</p> <p>   STEP FOUR:  Assemble the Ithkuil words     When  putting these elements together to render the final Ithkuil sentence, I take  the option to separate out some of the suffixes    into affixual adjuncts for the sake of phonetic  euphony.  Here  then, is the end result, accompanied by the most natural sounding literal  translation into English:</p> <p> Mmarnuq<sup>h</sup>a\u00a0 t<sup>h</sup>an-n\u00a0\u00a0hw\u00f6eqt\u00e0dh\u00fbb\u00fcp\u00a0\u00a0\u00f6eqt\u00f3u\u2019adhib\u00f6p.

I decided to write the lyrics in Ithkuil in order to explore using the language for (quasi-)poetic purposes, as I\u2019ve long threatened to do. </p> <p>It should be noted that I do not consider these song lyrics to be poetry per se, given that the lines are meant to be sung to music, so that syllables are often spread across multiple beats, or several syllables rushed through a single beat, all for a musically aesthetic effect.  If this were meant to be real poetry, I would demand a strict meter and specific alliterative scheme, perhaps with room for some sort of rhyme as well.</p> <p>Nevertheless, given the nature of the music and the subjects of the songs, the lyrics can be considered poetic in a quasi-verse sort of way.  The experience of writing them was very interesting, in that it allowed me to explore the language for use in conveying both metaphorical and psychological imagery.</p> <p>I have finished the actual musical production for five of these songs under the name Kaduat\u00e1n, that is \u201cWayfarers.\u201d</p> <p>Links to YouTube videos of these songs are below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Kaduat\u00e1n - Ozkavark\u00fai (\u201cGuessing Games\u201d)</p> <p>Lyrics with translation and morphological analysis</p> <p> </p> <p>Kaduat\u00e1n - U\u0148k\u2019\u00e0t\u00e2n (\u201cRenegades\u201d)</p> <p>Lyrics with translation</p> <p> </p> <p>Kaduat\u00e1n - \u00cendarna (\u201cSilent Questions\u201d)</p> <p>Lyrics with translation</p> <p> </p> <p>Kaduat\u00e1n - K\u0161\u00ealma\u0161t\u00f6\u00f6 (\u201cThe Clown Song\u201d)</p> <p>Lyrics with translation</p> <p> </p> <p>Kaduat\u00e1n - \u00d4r\u00f6dyagzou (\u201cSynaesthesia\u201d)</p> <p>Lyrics with translation</p>"},{"location":"update/","title":"Updates","text":"Ithkuil Update Updates / Changes Supplement to Lexicon (updated March 27, 2015) Ithkuil Grammar Book Errata <p>The character extension in Table 51 for the combination of \u017e + C is not valid.  The character extension for the value \u017e  + C  should instead be shown by the value in Table 52 previously assigned to  C + v.</p> <p>ALSO:  There are two new suffixes to deal with the issue of semantic frames. Here is a discussion of this topic and the details of the two new suffixes.</p> <p> </p> <p>The following addresses the issue regarding ambiguous consonantal  combinations in the Ithkuil writing system, specifically how to  distinguish combinations such as -pg- from -bg-, -kt- from -gt-, etc.  when writing the C<sub>r</sub> root.</p> <p>The character extension elements shown in Table 52 (in Section  11.3.4.1 of the Grammar) are redundant, given that they can be much more  easily shown using the subscript diacritics shown in Table 53.  The  original intent of these Table 53 diacritics was that they be used only  for tri-consonantal and tetra-consonantal roots, however there\u2019s no  reason not to use them in biconsonantal roots as well, which then  obviates the need for the character extensions shown in Table 52.   By  rendering these Table 52 extensions redundant, it makes them available  for use to disambiguate the k/g, p/b, t/d problem. </p> <p>Therefore, the Table 52 elements are hereby reassigned to indicate the following values: </p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + w will now indicate b + C</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + y will no longer be used</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + l will now indicate d + C</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + r will now indicate g + C</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + \u0159 will now indicate \u017c + C</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + m will now indicate j + C</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + n will now indicate dh + C</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + v will now indicate \u017e + C and  the extension shown in Table 51 for \u017e + C will no longer be used</p> <p>The extension previously indicating C + \u0148 will no longer be used</p> <p>As a result of the above, those character extension elements in Table  51 of the grammar which currently indicate dual/alternate values will  now only be used to indicate their primary value. </p> <p>Note that, using the subscript diacritics in lieu of the now-obsolete  values of the Table 52 character extension elements, might at first  glance give rise to ambiguities.  For example does the consonantal  character for /s/ plus an extension indicating prefixed /k/- plus a  subscript diacritic indicating +/n/ mean -KNS- or -KSN-?  However, no  ambiguity exists, as -KNS- is not a valid combination for a Cr root.  So  when interpreting how to read such combinations, the reader must bear  in mind Ithkuil phonotactical constraints. </p> <p>Note also that, with the above changes, quite a number of the  existing examples of Ithkuil script throughout the Ithkuil website and  grammar book are now unfortunately erroneous.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Here is how Ithkuil handles mathematical expressions and units of measurement.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>A new morphological category has been introduced:  Register.   Register indicates intra-sentence or intra-narrative changes in the  mode of personal communication from a general narrative to instead  indicate either one\u2019s personal cogitation/deliberation, an unwilled or  subjective impression, direct speech, or a parenthetical \u201caside\u201d.    Register is indicated phonologically by tone distinctions.  The first  word of a phrase carrying a specific register has one of five tones, and  the last word of the phrase carrying that register has rising tone to  indicate termination of the register.  Here are the specifics: </p> <p>NRR \u2013 NARRATIVE Tone marking:  falling (default)  Description:  The default register, indicating a general narrative  statement.  Also used for formal narration, as when telling the events a  story from an omniscient narrator\u2019s perspective. </p> <p>DSV \u2013 DISCURSIVE Tone marking: high Description: Indicates a phrase/statement represents direct speech, as in  \u2018His wife turned to him and said  \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten your hat.\u201d\u2019 \u201d </p> <p>PTH \u2013 PARENTHETICAL Tone marking:  low Description: Indicates a phrase/statement is a parenthetical aside, or the equivalent to an in-line footnote, as in  \u2018All equine species in Eurasia  (we needn\u2019t bother with those in the Americas) can be shown to be quadrupeds,\u2019  or  \u2018I generally prefer coffee to tea on summer afternoons \u2013 over ice, of course \u2013 but sometimes only a beer will do, \u2019 or  \u2018That artist\u2019s landscapes  (you should see his portraits!)  are simply sublime.\u2019  </p> <p>COG \u2013 COGITANT Tone marking:  falling-rising Description:  Indicates a phrase/statement represents silent thoughts or  beliefs.  Equivalent to various devices in natural languages for  indicating silent thoughts/beliefs within a narrative, as in the use of  italics within a written paragraph, or the sudden interjection of a  character\u2019s disembodied voice on the soundtrack of a film/video while  the character visually doesn\u2019t open their mouth. </p> <p>IPR \u2013 IMPRESSIONISTIC Tone marking:  rising-falling Description: I ndicates a phrase/statement represents the imagination,  subjective impressions, or unwilled \u201cwandering\u201d thoughts of the party  being referenced in the phrase/statement.  Equivalent in natural  languages to a narrator suddenly interjecting a subjective description  within a statement, as in  \u2018The little girl ran down the hillside, a feeling of joy in her heart, then leaped into the arms of her father.\u2019  </p> <p>NOTE:  Since it is not possible for an Ithkuil word to carry more  than one morphologically significant tone (see Sec. 1.3.2), if a  non-default register (i.e., a register other than NAR) is to be applied  to a single word only, this is indicated by the fact that there will be  no subsequent indication that the Register has terminated, i.e., there  will be no subsequent word carrying rising tone prior to the end of the  sentence or prior to a new/subsequent change to a non-NARRATIVE  register.  It is this absence of the register-termination tone marker  that retrospectively indicates that only the initial word of the  previous non-NARRATIVE utterance/statement carried that particular  register. </p> <p> </p> <p>Changes in how the categories of Version and Validation are phonologically marked. </p> <p>As a result of using tone to mark the new category of Register  described above, the existing phonological markers for the category of  Version (see Sec. 5.8) and Validation (see Sec. 5.9) are hereby changed.    These changes will entail the creation of a new Hearsay suffix, as  well as a revamping of the existing SCS suffix.  The details are as  follows: </p> <p>Both Version and Validation are now primarily shown via a consonantal  affix in Slot III.  The affix for Validation continues to be labelled C<sub>g</sub> and has priority over affixes showing Version.  The Version affix is arbitrarily labelled C<sub>n</sub>.  If Slot III is already occupied by C<sub>g</sub>,  then Version must be shown by the SCS suffix (-rk/kr-) in Slot XI.  The  SCS suffix has been re-formulated to accommodate all six Versions. </p> <p>The C<sub>n</sub> Version affix in Slot III can only  appear if the formative\u2019s Validation is in its default value  CNF-Confirmative.  Conversely, the default Version, PRC-Processual is  now completely unmarked, so that if a formative has both default CNF  Validation and default PRC Version, it will be the CNF Validation that  will occupy Slot III if required by the presence of a Valence affix in  Slot II. </p> <p>The number of C<sub>g</sub> Validations is hereby  reduced from fourteen to six.  This is because the existing nine hearsay  values are being collapsed into a single value; the Ithkuil  speaker/writer will instead now have to option to specify the exact  nature of the hearsay via a new Hearsay suffix in Slot XI.  The six  values for Validation are now as follows: </p> <p>CNF \u2013 CONFIRMATIVE C<sub>g</sub> affix:  glottal stop + h   NOTE:  CNF Validation is normally unmarked; this suffix only appears if a  Valence prefix occupies Slot II of the formative.  Also:  this suffix  is supplanted by any non-default C<sub>n</sub> Version affix. </p> <p>AFM \u2013 AFFIRMATIVE C<sub>g</sub> affix:  glottal stop + y</p> <p>RPT \u2013 REPORTIVE C<sub>g</sub> affix:  w-</p> <p>INF \u2013 INFERENTIAL C<sub>g</sub> affix:  glottal stop + w</p> <p>ITU \u2013 INTUITIVE C<sub>g</sub> affix:  hh-</p> <p>PSM \u2013 PRESUMPTIVE C<sub>g</sub> affix:  y- NOTE:  This is the new affix that collapses the previous nine hearsay  Validations into one.  If exact specification of the hearsay source is  desired, a new HSY-Hearsay VxC suffix is available for use in Slot XI.   If this HSY suffix is employed, then use of the PSM Cg affix in Slot III  is optional (i.e., it can be supplanted by a Cn Version affix or Slot  III can be left unfilled if there is no Valence affix in Slot II). </p> <p>The new HSY Hearsay suffix is -\u0148\u0163.  Its nine degrees match the previous nine hearsay Validations shown in Table 13(b) in Sec. 5.9. </p> <p>The six new C<sub>n</sub> Version affixes for Slot III are as follows: </p> <p>PRC \u2013 PROCESSUAL  [unmarked] </p> <p>CPT \u2013 COMPLETIVE  C<sub>n</sub> affix:  -h-</p> <p>INE \u2013 INEFFECTUAL  C<sub>n</sub> affix:  -hw-</p> <p>INC \u2013 INCOMPLETIVE  C<sub>n</sub> affix:  -hm-</p> <p>PST \u2013 POSITIVE  C<sub>n</sub> affix:  -hn-</p> <p>EFC \u2013 EFFECTIVE  C<sub>n</sub> affix:  -hr-</p> <p>If necessary to show Version using the SCS suffix because of the  presence of Cg, the new values of the SCS suffix are as follows: </p> <p>SCS  -rk / -kr  Degree of Success/Failure 1. total failure in; utterly fail to 2. INC version 3. INE version 4. certain to fail in, expected to fail in; anticipated/expected failure to 5. CPT version 6. certain to succeed in, expected to succeed in; anticipated/expected success in 7. PST version 8. EFC version 9. overwhelming success in; overwhelmingly successful</p> <p> </p> <p>Availability of new roots:  As a result of the changes above to permissible values in Slot III, the number of impermissible C<sub>r</sub>  root forms as stated in Table 3 (in Sec. 2.1.1) and in Sec. 2.2.1 is  now reduced from fourteen to eight.  The remaining prohibited root forms  are -w-, -y-, -h-, -hw-, -hr-, -hh-, -hn-, -hm-.</p> <p> </p> <p>Correction of Rule in Sec. 5.5</p> <p>In Sec. 5.5, just above Table 11, there is a note indicating two  methods by which one disambiguates (or correctly parses) the structure  of a formative when Slots V and VI are filled.  This information is  overly complicated and not entirely correct.  Specifically, the second  note regarding use of the Slot IX infix -w\u00eb- in the  presence of an incorporated root in Slots V and VI is both unnecessary  and incorrect.  Any incorporated root already mandatorily requires the  presence of a Format/Context affix in Slot XII, so there is no need for  any other means of indicating the function of Slots V and VI in that  situation.  It is also incorrect because the infix  -w\u00eb-  can also be used to increase the number of syllables in the word if  necessary for purposes of applying antepenultimate or  pre-antepenultimate stress (see the paragraph below Table 10 in Sec.  5.4.1). </p> <p>As a result, the only rule needed is for when Slots V and VI are occupied by the C<sub>v</sub> Phase/Sanction/Illocution affix and the V<sub>L</sub>  Valence affix.  Specifically, the note above Table 11 in Sec. 5.5  should be simplified and corrected to say that a glottal stop is  required immediately following the Vr affix in Slot IV whenever Slots V  and VI are filled by the C<sub>v</sub> and the V<sub>L</sub> valence affix.  No such glottal stop is required if Slots V and VI are occupied by an incorporated root C<sub>x</sub>+V<sub>p</sub>. </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Here is a list of seven new suffixes.  Also, it should be made clear that suffixes beginning with \u2013l or \u2013r can reverse their consonants for the sake of euphony if followed by a vowel (e.g., \u2013rk can become \u2013kr).   While this is explicitly shown in the existing grammar for some such  suffixes, for others it is not.  Nevertheless, this reversal of  consonants is applicable to any suffix beginning with \u2013l or \u2013r.</p> <p></p> <p> </p><p> </p> <p>The example sentence at the end of Sec. 8.1.4 in the Grammar,  illustrating use of the switch-reference suffix, has an error in it.   The fourth word should be  \u00e8k\u0161\u00fcl\u00f6t\u2019 (not ek\u0161\u00fcl\u00e9\u0148\u0163) and the morphological analysis below the sentence should show the suffix on this word as TPF<sub>1</sub>/2, not TPF<sub>1</sub>/3. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Case-Stacking Using Case Adjuncts</p> <p>The Ithkuil grammar is hereby amended to allow case stacking\u2014the  ability to assign two cases simultaneously to a formative (or to a  case-frame).  This is necessary to accurately translate sentences like  the following: </p> <p>  \u2018I jog every day except in case of illness.\u2019 or  \u2018I jog every day except during (an) illness.\u2019 </p> <p>In Ithkuil, \u201cexcept (for) X\u201d is expressed by the EXCEPTIVE case (Sec.  4.5.30), while the idea of \u201cin case of X\u201d is expressed by the  POSTULATIVE case (Sec. 4.5.28) and \u201cduring X\u201d by the CONCURSIVE case  (Sec. 4.6.3).  So how do we apply two different cases to the formative  which translates \u2018illness\u2019 when translating the above sentence?  Current  Ithkuil grammar would require such a sentence to be expressed  paraphrastically as something like  \u2018I jog every day except that I don\u2019t jog during illness.\u2019 </p> <p>To allow for two (or more) cases to be assigned to the same formative (or case-frame), case adjuncts  are now introduced, a new kind of adjunct which signifies the case of  the following case-frame (or formative if there is nothing but a  formative between the case adjunct and the end of the sentence) which  may, in turn have its own separate case.  The form of these case  adjuncts are based on Table 28 (in Section 8.1.2.2) as follows: </p> <p>For cases 1 through 48 (as per Table 28), the form of the adjunct is the consonant -w- plus Vc as indicated in Table 28.  Alternately, a \u201cfull\u201d form is available consisting of the Vc plus the syllable -wa.  Examples: wa = OBLIQUE case (or awa), woe = REFERENTIAL case (or oewa), w\u00ebu = VOCATIVE case (or \u00eb\u00fawa), etc.  Cases where Vc is -\u00fb- (i.e., the OGN case) or where Vc is a bisyllabic form beginning with -u- (i.e., the MED, APL, PUR, and CSD cases), must use the full form (in order to avoid phonetically undesirable forms such as w\u00fb or wuo, etc.) </p> <p>Cases 49 through 96 (as per Table 28) take the same forms except that the consonant -y- is substituted for -w-.  Cases where Vc is -\u00ee- (i.e., the ELP case) or where Vc is a bisyllabic form beginning with -i- (i.e., the LOC, ORI, PSV, and ALL cases), must use the full form (in order to avoid phonetically undesirable forms such as y\u00ee or yio, etc.) </p> <p>So now the original English sentence can be translated as follows using the EXCEPTIVE case adjunct  ya in conjunction with POSTULATIVE case on the following formative: </p> <p>Aigwaloek\u00e7 \u00a0 tu \u00a0 \u017co\u2019aluq<sup>h</sup> \u00a0 ya \u00a0 egloi\u2019l\u00f6at.

Specifically: </p> <p>falling tone = no specific element topicalized high tone = the first word following the adjunct is topicalized rising tone = the second word following the adjunct is topicalized low tone = the third word following the adjunct is topicalized rising-falling tone = the fourth word following the adjunct is topicalized falling-rising tone = the fifth word following the adjunct is topicalized</p> <p>This new ability to stack cases in Ithkuil also allows for  alternative ways to construct case-frames which are potentially more  elegant than what Ithkuil grammar previously allowed.

Additionally, by using the case  adjunct, it allows us to show \u2018rats\u2019 as the topic of the case-frame via  tone (high tone indicates the word immediately following the case  adjunct is the topic of the case-frame), eliminating the need to use a  TPF suffix to indicate the topicalization.  Note that use of the case  adjunct to mark the beginning of a case frame also eliminates the  requirement that case-frames have verb-initial word order, thus allowing  pragmatic relations such as semantic focus and topicalization within  the case-frame to be shown via word order. </p>"}]}
