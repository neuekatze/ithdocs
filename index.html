<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<p align="justify" class="style7"><br>
These webpages present the grammar of an artificially  constructed human language, <strong>Ithkuil</strong>.&nbsp; It has been designed with the following goals in mind:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1" class="style7">
  <li>
    <div align="justify">The       findings of cognitive science and 
cognitive linguistics since the        1980s show that human cognition 
gives rise to and processes far more       information than is overtly 
expressed by natural human languages.&nbsp; Theoretically, it should be 
possible to       design a human-usable language that overtly expresses 
more (or “deeper”)       levels/aspects of human cognition than are 
found in natural human       languages.</div>
  </li>
</ol>
<div align="justify">
  <ol start="2" type="1" class="style7">
    <li>Natural       human languages are notorious for their semantic 
ambiguity, polysemy       (multiple meanings for a given word), semantic
 vagueness, inexactitude,       illogic, redundancy, and overall 
arbitrariness.&nbsp; Theoretically, it should be possible to       
design the language to minimize these various characteristics in favor 
of       greater semantic precision, exactitude, and specification of a 
speaker’s       cognitive intent.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="3" type="1" class="style7">
    <li>The       above two goals would seemingly demand that the 
resulting language be       long-winded, since individual words of the 
language (or at least any       sentence as a whole) would have to 
convey much more morpho-semantic       content than their natural 
language counterparts.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it should theoretically be   
    possible to accomplish the above two goals while  achieving       
relatively concise morpho-phonological forms for words.&nbsp; In other 
words, to be able to pack a lot       of meaning and information into a 
relatively small number of syllables.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Ithkuil represents the culmination of 
my attempts over a period of thirty years or so to achieve the above 
goals. It should be noted that Ithkuil is NOT intended to function like a
 “natural” human language. 
  Ithkuil  exists as  an exercise in exploring how human languages <em>could</em> function, 
not how human languages <em>do</em> function.</p>

<p align="justify" class="style7">Ithkuil’s ability to express extensive
 cognitive detail in a concise manner is possible due to the design   of
 the grammar, essentially a matrix of grammatical concepts and 
structures   designed for compactness, cross-functionality and 
reusability. This matrix-like   grammar is combined with a 
vocabulary/lexicon of semantic stems which (1) are   capable of a high 
degree of flexibility and synergism within that matrix, (2)   have been 
completely reconceptualized from the cognitive level up regardless of   
their correspondence to actual word roots and grammatical categories in 
existing   languages, and (3) reflect the inherent dependencies and 
interrelationships   between one semantic concept and another. 
Therefore, the morphemes of the   language (i.e., word-roots, suffixes, 
prefixes, grammatical categories, etc.)   are as phonetically brief as 
possible, function in multiple roles with one   another, and correspond 
more closely to human cognitive categories than in   natural languages. 
In this fashion, a limited number of sounds and word-roots   can be made
 to generate a vast array of variations and derivations corresponding   
to and even surpassing all of the grammatical and semantic functions of 
the   usual stock of words, phrases, and idiomatic constructions in 
natural languages.   </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Additionally, the particular 
grammatical categories of the language, combined with a systematic and 
hierarchical derivational  morphology, allow for extreme transparency 
and flexibility in:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="style7">  gestalt conceptualization<br>
  </li>
  <li class="style7">conveying the evidential basis for an utterance<br>
  </li>
  <li class="style7">conveying the cognitive intent of an utterance<br>
  </li>
  <li class="style7">objective vs. subjective descriptions of objects, events, and phenomena<br>
  </li>
  <li class="style7">descriptions of the holistic vs. discrete componential structure of objects, situations, and phenomena<br>
  </li>
  <li class="style7">mechanistic vs. synergistic interpretations of objects, events, and phenomena</li>
  <li class="style7">the causal dynamics of complex  states, acts, events</li>
  <li class="style7">describing spatio-temporal  phenomena</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" class="style7"><br>
As an example of the morphological richness and efficiency possible in 
this  language, examine the following Ithkuil sentence, comparing it to 
its literal  English translation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style7"><strong><img src="/images/intro-1.jpg" width="136" height="50"><br>
  Tram-mļöi&nbsp;&nbsp;hhâsmařpţuktôx.</strong></p>
  <p><span class="style7">TRANSLATION: <br>
    ‘<em>On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this    rugged mountain range trails off at some point</em>.’</span>
    <span class="style7"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
  <p class="style26">NOTE: See  Phonology, <a href="https://ithkuil.place/mirror/2004-en/01_phonology.html#Sec1o2">Section  1.2</a> on how to pronounce the Romanized orthography used to transliterate the  Ithkuil characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style7">  The reader may well wonder why it 
takes a 19-word sentence in English to  translate a two-word Ithkuil 
sentence. One might assume the sentence “cheats”  in that the two 
Ithkuil words simply have innately intricate and specialized  meanings. 
While it is true that the first word, <strong>tram-mļöi</strong>, translates as ‘<em>on the contrary, it may  turn out at some point (that...)</em>,’ and the second word, <strong>hhâsmařpţuktôx</strong>, means ‘<em>I have a  feeling this unevenly high range of mountains trails off</em>,’
 it would be  quite erroneous to conclude that these are simply 
autonomous words one might  theoretically find in an Ithkuil dictionary.
 Indeed, the only part of the  sentence that represents any sort of 
“root” word is -<strong>âsm</strong>-, a stem more or less meaning  
‘hill’ or ‘upland.’ The remainder of the sentence is made up entirely of
  morphological, not lexical components, i.e., prefixes, suffixes, 
infixes, vowel  permutations, shifts in stress and tone, etc. For 
example, the first word, <strong>tram-mļöi</strong>, has three parts to it as  shown below:</p>

<p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">  In addition to its morphology, 
Ithkuil is different from other languages in the   way its lexicon 
(stock of word-roots) has been created as well as in the principles   
underlying its lexico-semantics (the relationship between words and 
meaning). In   natural languages, the choice as to what mental concepts 
and categories will be   overtly reflected as word-roots and stems is 
arbitrary and unsystematic (while   in most invented languages, the 
lexicon is by and large consciously or   sub-consciously patterned after
 that of natural languages). While it is true   that virtually all 
languages reflect certain basic universals of word choice   (e.g., all 
have words for <em>sun, moon, speak, mother, father, laugh, I, you,   one, two, water, blood, black, white, hot, cold</em>,
 etc.), the manner in which   these words are created is haphazard and 
with little regard for basic conceptual   interrelationships. The 
result, in most cases, is a plethora of separate,   distinct word roots 
which bear no morpho-phonological, or morpho-semantic   relation to one 
another (i.e., the patterns of sounds used to create particular   words 
are unsystematic and independent for each word-root regardless of 
whether   those word-roots are semantically or cognitively related to 
one another).   Ithkuil word-roots have been created in a more efficient
 and systematic manner,   with a recognition that the interrelatedness 
between what are large sets of   discrete words in other languages can 
be formalized and systematized into a vast   array or matrix of 
derivational rules, the result being a drastic reduction in   the number
 of basic word-roots, which in turn allows all individual stems to be   
extremely compact phonologically-speaking. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">For example, consider the following series of English words: <em>see, sight, vision, glimpse, stare, gawk, view, panorama, look, eye, glance,   visualize</em>.
 Note how each of these is a separate, autonomous word despite   the 
fact that it shares a single underlying semantic concept with the others
 (a   concept which we can conveniently refer to as SIGHT/VISION),   
each representing a mere manipulation of either durational aspect, 
situational   perspective, or manner of participation relating to that 
underlying concept.   What is more, these manipulations are, by and 
large, haphazardly applied, vague,   subjective, and particular to the 
specific underlying concept (i.e., the   aspectual/perspectival 
manipulations applied to SIGHT/VISION   do not parallel those 
manipulations applied to the concept TRANSFERENCE OF POSSESSION by which
 we derive the series <em>give,   take, receive, steal, donate, lend, borrow, send</em>, etc.). </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">In Ithkuil, it is the seminal 
underlying concept which is   lexified into a word-root which then 
undergoes a series of regular, predictable,   and universally applicable
 modifications at the morphological (i.e.,   grammatical) level to 
generate new words that, in some cases, parallel such   series of 
English words, but in most cases, far exceed the dynamism and range of  
 such English word series. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Another principle underlying the formation of words in Ithkuil   is <strong>complementarity</strong>.
 Western thought and language generally   reflect Aristotelian logic in 
the way they conceptualize the world and the   interrelationships 
between discrete entities in that world. Ithkuil, on the   other hand, 
views the world as being based on complementary principles, where,   
instead of discrete independence between related entities, such concepts
 are   seen as complementary aspects of a single holistic entity. Such 
complementarity   is in turn reflected in the derivation of word-roots. 
By “complementarity” is   meant that the manifestation of a concept 
appears in any given context as either   one sort of entity or another, 
but never both simultaneously; yet, neither   manifestation can be 
considered to be a discrete whole without the existence of   the other. A
 simple illustration of complementarity is the flip of a coin: the   
coin can only land on one side or the other, yet without both sides 
being part   of the coin, any given coin toss has no meaning or 
contextual relevance no   matter which side is face-up. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">For example, in Western languages, words such as <em>male</em>, <em>night</em>, <em>limb</em>, <em>sit</em>, and <em>happen</em>
 are all   autonomous words, linguistically representing what are 
inherently considered to   be basic mental concepts or semantic 
primitives. However, in Ithkuil, none of   these words is considered to 
be a semantic primitive. Instead, they are seen to   be parts of 
greater, more holistic semantic concepts, existing in complementary   
relationship to another part, the two together making up the whole. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Thus, Ithkuil lexical structure recognizes that the word <em>male</em> has no meaning in and of itself without an implicit recognition of   its complementary partner, <em>female</em>, the two words mutually deriving from   a more basic, holistic concept, translatable into English as <em>living   being</em>. Similarly, the word <em>night(time)</em> derives along with its   complement <em>day(time)</em> from the underlying concept translatable as <em>day</em> (24-hour period), while <em>limb</em>, along with its complement <em>trunk</em> or <em>torso</em>, derives from the stem <em>(corporeal)   body</em>. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Actions, too, are not exempt from this principle of   complementarity, an example being the relationship between <em>sit</em> and <em>seat</em>;
 one has no meaning without an implicit and joint partnership with   the
 other, i.e., one cannot sit unless one sits upon something, and 
whatever one   sits upon automatically functions as a seat. We see the 
awkward attempt of   English to convey these jointly dependent but 
mutually exclusive perspectives   when comparing the sentences <em>Please sit down</em> and <em>Please be   seated</em>. Another example involves the word <em>happen</em> or <em>occur</em>, which Ithkuil recognizes as having no real meaning without the   attendant implication of <em>consequence</em> or <em>result</em>, the two being   complementary components of a holistic concept roughly translatable as <em>event</em> or <em>situation</em>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">The Ithkuil word for <em>hole</em> 
illustrates another instance   of complementarity. Holes can be looked 
at from two different, but interrelated   perspectives: either as an 
opening connecting two different spaces (or access   point to a 
previously unavailable space, i.e., a pit), or as a discontinuity in   
the surface or structural integrity of the dividing entity separating 
the two   realms. In other words, one can focus on the potential 
function or consequences   of the hole, or on the structural nature of 
the hole. Either of these two   perspectives represents a legitimate, 
but complementary way to consider a hole   or puncture. Thus, the 
Ithkuil word would have two derivative roots each   indicating one of 
these two perspectives. One such root would be used when   saying <em>There’s a hole in your shirt</em>, while the other would be used when   saying <em>She saw me through a hole in the fence</em>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Ithkuil recognizes that such 
complementarity exists for   virtually any concept, in fact that it is 
one of the foundational principles of   the universe itself. No beam of 
light can be spoken of without implicit   recognition of its source. No 
signal can be described without accounting for the   signaling device. 
Indeed, in Ithkuil no river is without its channel, no surface   without
 its firmament, no message without its medium, no sense impression   
without its sense faculty, no contents without their container, no 
occurrence   without its consequence, no memory without its present 
effect, no plan without   its purpose, no music without its playing, no 
relief without prerequisite   deprivation, no pleasure without its 
absence, no motion without space in which   to move.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Other principles underlying Ithkuil 
word-derivation include the   interrelated principles of fuzzy logic, 
prototype theory, and radial   categorization. Incorporation of these 
principles into the architecture for   word-formation allows roots to be
 grouped into various types of affiliated sets,   each of which then 
functions as a conceptual gestalt, the individual members of   which 
being marked as having varying degrees and kinds of relatedness or   
similarity to a hypothetical prototype member or archetype. Thus, 
Ithkuil is   able to systematically derive words such as <em>crowd, mob, group, troop, club,   association, assembly, </em>and <em>gathering</em> all from the single root-word <em>person</em>. Similarly, words such as <em>grove, orchard, forest, woods,   jungle</em>, and <em>copse</em> can all be derived from the single root-word <em>tree</em>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">As one last example exemplifying the 
dynamism and conciseness   of Ithkuil lexico-semantics, consider the 
following list of English words and   phrases: <em>drenched, wet, damp, moist, near-dry, dry, parched</em>.
 Rather   than provide separate autonomous words for these concepts, 
Ithkuil recognizes   that these terms all indicate relative degrees of 
moisture along a continuous   range. Such continua would be addressed by
 a single root whose meaning more or   less corresponds to [DEGREE OF] 
MOISTURE to which an array   of simple suffixes would be added to 
specify the particular degree along that   range, all the way from <em>bone dry</em> (or <em>parched</em>) through <em>drenched </em>to<em> saturated</em>. All such phenomena which Western   languages tend to semantically delineate into binary oppositions (e.g., <em>hard/soft, light/dark, shallow/deep</em>,
 etc.) are recognized and lexified   in Ithkuil as single roots which 
then systematically use suffixes to specify the   particular degree 
along a continuous range.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">The above paragraphs illustrate how 
Ithkuil is able to capture   and systematically present at the 
morphological level what other languages   accomplish haphazardly at the
 lexical level. By systematically finding and   structuring the covert 
dependencies and interrelationships between what are   disparate words 
in other languages, the hundreds of thousands of words in a   language 
like English are drastically reduced down to the approximately 3600 
word-roots of   Ithkuil. This is morpho-lexical efficiency on a grand 
scale. Nevertheless, by   means of the matrix-like morphological scheme 
previously described, each of   these  roots can in turn generate 
thousands of permutations to convey   complex and subtle semantic 
distinctions and operations which dwarf the capacity   of existing 
languages to convey without resorting to cumbersome paraphrase. This   
is lexico-semantic and morpho-semantic efficiency on an equally grand 
scale.   Such a synergistic design for grammar lends a dynamism that 
allows the Ithkuil   language to describe reality to a minute level of 
detail and exactitude despite   a limited number of word-roots. This 
dynamism is visible throughout this work,   but is discussed in 
systematic detail in <a href="https://ithkuil.place/mirror/2004-en/10_lexico-semantics.html">Chapter 10: Lexico-Semantics</a>.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p align="justify" class="style7">To further illustrate the cognitive 
depth at which Ithkuil   operates, consider one of the most pervasive 
aspects of natural human languages:   semantic vagueness. For example, 
consider the following four English   sentences:</p>
<blockquote class="style7">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">(a)<em> The boy rolled down the hill.</em><br>
      (b) <em>Maybe she   just stopped smoking.</em><br>
      (c) <em>Joe didn’t win the lottery   yesterday.</em><br>
      (d) <em>There is a dog on my   porch.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" class="style7">In examining these four sentences most
 native English speakers   would deny that any vagueness exists. This is
 because the vagueness does not   exist in terms of the overt meanings 
of the words themselves. Rather, the   vagueness lies at the nearly 
subconscious level of their grammatical (or   syntactical) relations and
 cognitive intent. For example, in sentence (a) we   have no idea 
whether the boy chose to roll himself down the hill or whether he   was 
pushed against his will. (In formal linguistic terms we would say it is 
  unknown whether the semantic role of the subject ‘boy’ is as <em>agent</em> or <em>patient</em>.) And yet knowing which scenario is correct is crucial to   understanding the speaker’s intent in describing the action. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Imagine sentence (b) <em>Maybe she just stopped smoking</em>
 being spoken as an answer to the question ‘Why does she seem so 
irritable?’ In   interpreting sentence (b), we have no idea whether the 
subject is indeed a   smoker or not; i.e., is the speaker offering this 
speculation because he/she   knows the subject to be a smoker, or as 
mere conjecture without knowledge one   way or the other whether the 
subject smokes or not? </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Sentence (c) <em>Joe didn’t win the lottery yesterday</em>
 illustrates four-way ambiguity. Joe’s failure to win the lottery could 
be either   because: the speaker knows Joe didn’t play; because the 
speaker knows Joe did   play but lost; because the speaker doesn’t know 
whether Joe played or not and is   simply voicing a conjecture; or 
because the statement is an inference based on   some indirect clue 
(e.g., since Joe showed up for work today, he must not have   won the 
lottery).</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">And while sentence (d) <em>There is a dog on my porch   s</em>eems
 on its surface to be the most straightforward of the four,   is the 
intent of the speaker to simply describe and identify the participants 
to   a scene, or does she wish to convey the idea that the scene has 
personal   significance to her, e.g., because she has a phobia of dogs 
or has been waiting   for a long-lost pet dog to return home? In other 
words, the sentence itself does   not convey the intent behind the 
utterance, only the static description of the   scene.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">In all four instances, such vagueness 
exists unless and until   the audience can ascertain information from 
the surrounding context of other   sentences. This shows that, despite 
the fact that all four sentences are   grammatically well-formed English
 sentences whose words in and of themselves are   unambiguous, their 
grammar alone is insufficient to convey the cognitive   information 
necessary to fully comprehend the intent of the speaker’s utterance.   
This failure of grammar to inherently convey the requisite information 
necessary   to understand a speaker’s cognitive intent is a functional 
pitfall of human   language in general which Ithkuil grammar has been 
designed to avoid. The   Ithkuil equivalents to the above four sentences
 would mandatorily convey all of   the “missing” information noted above
 without requiring any extra words not   corresponding to the English 
originals. The grammatical elements of the words   themselves 
(word-selection, declensions, conjugations, prefixes, suffixes, etc.)   
would convey all the elements mentioned.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Similar examples can be given to show 
the extent to which   natural languages such as English must often 
resort to idiomatic expressions,   metaphor, paraphrase, circumlocution 
and “supra-segmental” phenomena (e.g.,   changing the pitch of one’s 
voice) in their attempts to convey a speaker’s   intended meaning. 
Ithkuil grammar has been designed to overtly and unambiguously   reflect
 the intention of a speaker with a minimum of such phenomena.</p>

<p align="justify" class="style7">Those readers familiar with the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language" target="_blank">artificial language construction</a>
 might think this endeavor   belated or unnecessary, in that logical 
languages such as James Cooke Brown’s renowned Loglan   (or its popular 
derivative, Lojban) already exist. This serves to illustrate   exactly 
what distinguishes Ithkuil from such previous attempts. Loglan was   
published in the 1950s as a spoken/written language based on symbolic 
logic   (formally known as the first-order predicate calculus), an 
algorithmic system of   symbol manipulation devised by mathematicians 
and logicians. As a result, one   might think that such a language is 
the most capable means of achieving logical,   unambiguous linguistic 
communication. However, Loglan and its derivatives are   merely 
sophisticated tools for symbol manipulation, i.e., the levels of 
language    known as morphology and syntax. It is not within the scope 
of   such languages to address any reorganization of the semantic realm.
 This means   that symbolic logic simply manipulates arguments which are
 input into the   system, they do not analyze the origin of those 
arguments in terms of meaning,   nor are they capable of analyzing or 
formalizing the structure of the cognitive   or semantic realm of the 
human mind in terms of how meaning itself is assigned   to arguments. 
(Indeed, Lojban derives its roots via statistical “sampling” of   the 
most frequent roots in the six most spoken natural languages, a method  
 virtually guaranteed to carry over into the Lojban lexicon all of the  
 lexico-semantic inefficiencies previously described.) By not addressing
 these   components of language, Loglan and similar efforts fail to 
address the   inconsistencies and inefficiency inherent in language at 
the lexico-semantic   level. Ithkuil has been designed to systematically
 address this issue. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Other readers might think of 
international languages (or   “interlanguages”) such as Esperanto, 
Interlingua, or Ido, as being logical and   efficient representations of
 language. However, these languages are merely   simplified, regularized
 amalgamations of existing languages (usually   Indo-European), designed
 for ease of learning. While addressing many overt   irregularities, 
inconsistencies, and redundancies of language found at the   
morpho-phonological and morpho-syntactic levels, they do little to 
address the   problems found within the other components of language, 
especially the   lexico-semantic. For example, while Esperanto admirably
 employs systematic rules   for word derivation as <em>knabo</em> ‘boy’ versus <em>knabino</em>
 ‘girl,’ it   preserves the basic lexico-semantic categorization scheme 
of Indo-European   languages in general, rather than seeking 
opportunities to expand such word   derivation schemes into 
multidimensional arrays as is done in Ithkuil.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">All in all, neither logical languages 
such as Loglan nor   interlanguages such as Esperanto, are designed 
specifically to achieve the   purpose of cognitive exactness and 
conciseness of communication which is the   goal of Ithkuil. Actually, 
Ithkuil might more readily be compared with the <a href="http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html" target="_blank">analytical language of John Wilkins</a>
 of the Royal Society of   London, published in 1668, in which he 
divided the realm of human conception   into forty categories, each 
containing a hierarchy of subcategories and   sub-subcategories, each in
 turn systematically represented in the phonological   structure of an 
individual word. While unworkable in   terms of specifics, Wilkins’ 
underlying principles are similar in a simplistic   way to some of the 
abstract derivational principles employed in Ithkuil   lexico-morphology
 and lexico-semantics. Another comparable predecessor in a   simplistic 
sense is the musical language, Solresol, created by Jean François   
Sudre and published in 1866.</p>

<p align="justify"><span class="style7">The design of Ithkuil has slowly
 and painstakingly evolved from my   early attempts as a teenager 
(following my introduction to the Sapir-Whorf   hypothesis and Charles 
Fillmore’s seminal 1968 article on case grammar) to   explore beyond the
 boundaries of Western Indo-European languages to a complex,   intricate
 array of interwoven grammatical concepts, many of which are wholly of  
 my own creation, others of which have been inspired by such obscure 
linguistic   sources as the morpho-phonology of Abkhaz verb complexes, 
the moods of verbs in   certain American Indian languages, the aspectual
 system of Niger-Kordofanian   languages, the nominal case systems of 
Basque and the Dagestanian languages, the   enclitic system of Wakashan 
languages, the positional orientation systems of   Tzeltal and Guugu 
Yimidhirr, the Semitic triliteral root morphology, and the   hearsay and
 possessive categories of Suzette Elgin’s Láadan language, not to   
mention ideas inspired by countless hours studying texts in theoretical 
  linguistics, cognitive grammar, psycholinguistics, language 
acquisition,   linguistic relativity, semantics, semiotics, philosophy, 
fuzzy set theory, and   even quantum physics. The writings of the 
American cognitive linguists George Lakoff, Ronald Langacker, Gilles 
Fauconnier, and Len Talmy have been particularly influential on 
Ithkuil’s design.</span></p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">The Ithkuil writing system likewise 
derives from both original   and inspired sources: it employs a unique 
“morpho-phonemic” principle of my own   invention, its logical design 
borrows from the mutational principles underlying   the Ethiopic and 
Brahmi scripts, and its aesthetic visual design bears a   superficial 
resemblance to Hebrew square script and the various Klingon   fonts.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">The first  version of  Ithkuil was 
originally posted to the Internet in early  2004.&nbsp; A second, 
alternative version of the language called Ilaksh   was posted during 
mid-2007, designed  specifically to address the many requests   for a 
version of the  language with a simpler phonology (sound system). <span class="style7">During
 the course of modifying the original version of Ithkuil into  Ilaksh, I
 realized  there were many aspects of Ilaksh design that could be  
incorporated back into Ithkuil without the constraints of Ilaksh on the 
number  of consonants and vowels. This would (hopefully)  allow the 
language to be more euphonic to the  ear while maintaining its 
morpho-phonological conciseness.&nbsp;</span>Additionally, hindsight has
 caused me to re-think  a few fine points of the grammar, which this 
latest design allows me to  incorporate into the language.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+1">Introduced in July 2011, t</font><font size="+1">his
 third incarnation of the language (which shall retain  the name 
“Ithkuil” out of convenience and continuity with the original  version),
 reflects these ideas and now constitutes what I  consider to be  the 
definitive (or “official”) version of the language. The name of the 
language is an anglicized form of the word <strong>iţkuîl</strong>, which means more or less <span class="style9"><font size="+1">“</font>hypothetical representation of a language<font size="+1">”</font></span> in the original version of Ithkuil.</font></p>

<p align="justify" class="style7"><a name="terminology" id="terminology"></a>This
 website provides a systematic presentation of the grammar   of the 
language. In addition to a description of the various components of the 
  grammar, the reader will find example phrases or sentences 
illustrating those   components. The navigational links at   the top and
 bottom of this page lead to chapters on the major grammatical 
components of   the language and should be preferably read in sequence, 
as each chapter is cumulative and   assumes knowledge of the preceding. 
While this grammar assumes only a basic   knowledge of linguistic 
concepts, it will be helpful to briefly familiarize the   reader with 
the hierarchical/schematic structure of human language in general,   as 
the organization of this grammar is somewhat based around this 
structure. The   analysis of human language can be organized into the 
following hierarchical   schema of primary concepts:</p>
<ul class="style7">
  <li>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Phonology</strong>: The manner in which
 vocally   articulated sound is structured for use within a language; 
this is the basic   realm of the acoustic sounds produced by the lungs, 
vocal cords, tongue, and   lips, i.e., consonants, vowels, volume, 
pitch, tone, stress, etc.<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Morphology</strong>: The grammatical 
rules,   structures, categories and functions which can be manipulated 
to form words and   the component phrases of sentences; this is the 
realm of prefixes, suffixes,   word-roots, and conceptual categories 
like tense, singular vs. plural, moods,   active vs. passive voice, etc.<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Syntax</strong>: The rules governing how words and   phrases can be combined into grammatically acceptable sentences. <br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Semantics</strong>: The realm of meaning; what the   words, phrases, and syntactical structures of the language represent in terms of   meaning.<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Lexicon</strong>: The list of word-roots within a   language, i.e., the vocabulary of the language. <br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Pragmatics</strong> <strong>and Discourse   Rules</strong>:
 The analysis of how language is actually used in real-world   
situations as determined by cultural and context-driven rules; the realm
 of   style, rhetoric, formal versus informal language, slang, etc., 
outside the realm   of grammar. Because this is a formal grammar for a 
hypothetical language (i.e.,   it has no “real world” linguistic 
context), pragmatics and discourse rules will   not be covered. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="justify" class="style7">
  <div align="justify">
    <blockquote>
      <div align="justify">
        <div align="justify"></div>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
<div align="justify" class="style7">The above components of language in 
turn operate in an   interrelated fashion, combining to designate 
several additional or secondary   levels of analysis. For example:</div>
<div align="justify" class="style7">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morpho-phonology</strong>: The interrelationship between
 phonology   and morphology, i.e., the manner in which the sounds of the
 language are   manipulated into structures that can contain meaning. 
For example it is   morpho-phonology that explains why different 
word-endings signify concepts such   as masculine or feminine in 
Spanish. <br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Morpho-syntax</strong>: The interrelationship between 
morphology and   syntax, i.e., how the grammatical structures within 
words impact the overall   structure of a sentence, as illustrated by 
the relationship between the   sentences <em>It is undeliverable</em> versus <em>It cannot be   delivered</em>.<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lexico-Morphology</strong>: The interrelationship 
between morphology   and the lexicon, i.e., the structure of word-roots 
and how they interact with   other morphological categories, as 
illustrated by the concept of “irregular”   verbs, e.g., ‘go’ + PAST = 
‘went.’<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lexico-Semantics</strong>: The interrelationship between
 the lexicon   and semantics, i.e. between words and their meaning; what
 mental concepts are   selected by a language to be instantiated as 
word-roots and the cognitive   processes behind the selection criteria. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="justify" class="style7">The interrelationships between these components can be   illustrated by the following diagram.</p>
<p align="center" class="style7"><img height="198" src="/images/Intro_1.gif" width="479" align="top"></p>
<p align="center" class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">Each example comprises an Ithkuil 
word, phrase, or sentence written   in native Ithkuil script, 
accompanied by a Romanized transliteration, an English   translation 
(sometimes divided into a “natural” versus literal translation), and   a
 morphological analysis. The morphological analysis is presented 
serially,   morpheme-by-morpheme, using three-letter abbreviations or 
labels for Ithkuil   morphological categories. These labels are 
presented within the body of the work   in conjunction with the 
explanation of each morphological category. A <a href="https://ithkuil.place/mirror/2004-en/abbreviations.html">list of these abbreviations</a> is also available on the main naviagtional menu at the top and bottom of each page of the site.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">This work is not meant as a primer or 
means of self-instruction   in speaking the language, a task beyond even
 its creator, given that Ithkuil may   be perhaps the most grammatically
 complex language ever devised. Simplicity was   not my purpose, but 
rather bridging the gap between extreme morphological   dynamism, the 
overt reflection of human cognitive processes via language, and   
extreme morpho-semantic economy and efficiency. I believe I have 
achieved a   result which is close to the ideal I sought. I leave it to 
the reader to explore   that result.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style7"><span class="style7"> My work on Ithkuil is dedicated to my brother Paul, in fond remembrance of <em>Kccoj</em>, <em>Mbozo</em>, and all the fun times we had</span> growing up playing with language and linguistics. <em>Aniamtrexu tanskbitero!</em></p>
<p align="justify" class="style7">And I dedicate this new 2011 version of the language to  Ms. Alla Vishneva<span class="style7">, who teaches students about Ithkuil in Kyiv, Ukraine, and to whom  my work is as important as it is to me. <em>Дякую, Алла. Ти маєш рацію!</em></span></p>
