<p class="style10"><br />
  The term <strong>lexico-semantics</strong> refers to the relationship 
  between the lexicon of a language (i.e., its root-words and word-stems) and 
  the various possible semantic categories created by the human mind. Every language 
  (and particularly every language family) divides the world up differently in 
  terms of what sorts of concepts are made into words and how the meanings of 
  those words reflect the reality around us. In other words, the lexico-semantics 
  of a language answers the questions <em>what semantic concepts does this language 
    psycho-linguistically categorize into autonomous words and how are each of these 
categories internally organized?</em></p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Lexico-semantics is extremely important in Ithkuil for two 
  related reasons:</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">1) Ithkuil morpho-phonology only allows for 3600 possible root 
  words, as explained in Chapter 2. This means that the concepts chosen to be 
  conveyed by these roots must be carefully selected to insure the widest range 
  of conceptualization possible within such a limited framework.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">2) We have seen throughout this work how Ithkuil&#8217;s matrix-like 
  grammatical structure allows for an incredible amount of synergy in terms of 
  morphological word-derivation, generating wholly new, emergent concepts from 
  word-roots, not simply mere conjugations, declensions, and transparent derivations. 
  In order to ensure the maximum amount of dynamism in deriving new concepts morphologically 
  from existing word-roots, it is important that those initial roots be carefully 
  selected in terms of meaning.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">In this chapter, we will examine the many considerations that 
  go in to the assigning of concepts to those 3600 roots, in order to optimally 
  accomplish what has been demonstrated throughout this work: using the dynamics 
  of Ithkuil morphology to eliminate the need for the hundred thousand or more 
  autonomous word roots of natural languages, or to put it colloquially, &#8220;getting 
  the most lexico-semantic bang for the morpho-phonological buck.&#8221; </p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">We will start first with a review of key components in the 
  systemic design of Ithkuil morphology. This will be followed by sections on 
  those areas of Ithkuil lexico-semantics which are most profoundly distinct from 
  Western languages. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">The last section deals with comparison to Western categorizations, 
  examining how Ithkuil lexico-semantics reinterprets certain concepts considered 
  &#8220;fundamental&#8221; in English and other Western languages.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style10">Note on Ithkuil's Implicit &#8220;Theory of Meaning&#8221;</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">For those readers who may be trained in linguistics, particulary cognitive linguistics, it should be noted that at this point in the author&#8217;s development of the language, a traditional Enlightenment-based theory of meaning, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between a lexeme and its external &#8220;in-the-world&#8221; referent, has been implicitly assumed for convenience and/or expediency&#8217;s sake. A more careful and rigourous construction for Ithkuil&#8217;s lexico-semantics, given the author&#8217;s stated design goals (as described in the Introduction section), would not assume such a theory of meaning, but would rather incorporate more recent findings of cognitive science and cognitive linguistics to reflect embodied meaning and metaphor-based conceptualization. However, pursuing such a foundation for the lexico-semantics of the language would, in the author&#8217;s opinion, be extremely time-consuming (on the order of many additional years, perhaps decades, to construct). Rather than withdraw the language from public availability for such reasons, the author has chosen instead to adopt a traditional/formalist foundation for its lexico-semantics essentially out of convenience, in order to be able to showcase the language's morphology. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style10">Ithkuil systematically uses its myriad of morphological categories 
  to derive secondary concepts from more basic concepts, often eliminating the 
  need for separate lexicalization, i.e., eliminating the need to create separate 
  word-roots for new but related concepts as is so often the case in Western languages. 
  We will explore this system of morphological derivation more closely, particularly 
  in regard to its universality across the spectrum of Ithkuil word-roots.</p>

  of complementary stems from the initial holistic array of stems. Through this 
  system of vowel shifts, we saw how a single root generates no

  <span class="style10">As described in <a href="02_morpho-phonology.html">Chapter 2</a>, this hierarchical pattern of stem 
  derivation and division into complementary stems from a more basic or underlying 
  &#8220;holistic&#8221; stem allows for significant collapsing in the number 
  of word-roots necessary compared to Western languages, as words that are semantically 
  interrelated in a hierarchical or complementary fashion can be derived morphologically 
  from a basic root, as opposed to being assigned separate word-roots as in other 
  languages. The above root -<strong>k</strong>- demonstrates how concepts such <em>come</em> versus <em>go</em> are expressed as complementary derivations of a single underlying concept TRANSLATIVE 
    MOTION. All such complementary stems based on participant perspective 
are similarly patterned, e.g., <em>lead/follow, buy/sell, give/take</em>, etc.</span></p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Additionally, this hierarchical structure of stem derivation 
  from a single root using vocalic infixes allows for the creation of &#8220;built-in&#8221; 
  classification schemes and taxonomies for concepts which require them. Biological 
  taxonomies, for example, can be easily accommodated under this scheme, first 
  dividing the two Forms (Designations) of the root into the animal itself versus 
  the animal as a resource, the holistic stems indicating first the generic species 
  then male versus female. The complementary stems then make the further distinction 
  between wild versus domesticated for the informal stem and between food/prey 
  and derived or processed products for the formal stem. </p>

  ways to indicate whether the singer used physical force or persuasion to stop 
  the boys, whether she stopped them via an indirect enabling means (such as turning 
  out the lights), or whether it was the boys themselves who stopped upon hearing

  Again we see that application of morphological categories 
  to word-stems serves to generate forms which substitute for lexical distinctions 
in other languages, thus helping to reduce the size of the Ithkuil lexicon.</p>

<h3 align="justify">10.1.5 The Use of Phase and Extension</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">The use of the nine Phases, as explained in <a href="05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o5">Sec. 
  5.5</a>, used in conjunction with the category of Extension (<a href="03_morphology.html#Sec3o4">Sec. 
    3.4</a>) gives rise to an elaborate means by which to describe phenomena in 
  terms of duration, periodicity, repetition, iterativity, and cyclic phenomena. 
  When used in conjunction with the twelve Modulative suffixes from <a href="07_suffixes.html#Sec7o4o7">Sec. 
    7.4.7</a>, the Iteration <span class="style7"><a href="07_suffixes.html#ITNsuffix">ITN</a></span> and Repetition <span class="style7"><a href="07_suffixes.html#RPNsuffix">RPN</a></span> suffixes from Sec. 7.4.5 and the Intensity <span class="style7"><a href="07_suffixes.html#ITYsuffix">ITY</a></span> suffix from Sec. 7.4.10, 
  Phase becomes an extremely powerful means to describe with great subtlety all 
  phenomena which display vibratory, oscillative, wavering, on-off, or variative 
  movement, motion, or intensity. As an example, specific application of the various 
  phases combined with the aforementioned suffixes and other suffix categories to 
  a single stem  <strong>-nt-</strong> &#8216;[make] sound&#8217; can give rise to translations for all of the following

  The same principles applied to other types of stems give rise

<h3 align="justify">10.1.6 Note on the Absence of Lexico-Semantic &#8220;Classes&#8221;</h3>
<p align="justify"><span class="style10">It should be noted that in  previous versions of the language, formative roots were divided into lexico-semantic &#8220;classes&#8221; designated by the phonological patterning of the root (there were 17 such classes in the original version of Ithkuil, ten such classes in Ilaksh). In the current version of the language, these lexico-semantic classes have been eliminated, as the author has realized that the establishment of such classes does not serve any real functional purpose in &#8220;real-world&#8221; spoken/written contexts; the ability to identify the semantic class of a stem does not sufficiently aid in understanding the stem&#8217;s specific meaning. Therefore, the  assignment of phoneme patterns to roots in Ithkuil is now arbitrary.  While the astute reader will  note that many roots pertaining to a specific semantic notion (e.g., animals, plant and substance taxonomies, spatial position, etc.) still have similar phonological patterning, such patterning is nevertheless merely incidental and is without formal significance. </span></p>

</table>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Another area of the lexicon where Western languages tend to 
  divide up reality into binary oppositions is the realm of spatial dimensions, 
  where pairs such as <em>near/far, small/large, thin/thick, narrow/wide, tall/short, 
    light/heavy, hot/cold</em>, etc. are commonplace. As with the perspective-based 
  oppositions seen in the preceding section, again Ithkuil lexico-semantics treats 
  such concepts in a wholly different way. Rather than lexicalize such concepts 
  as pairs of binary oppositions, Ithkuil delineates these qualities as <em>varying 
    points along a continuous range</em>. In other words, in Ithkuil you do not 
  say <em>X is cold</em> and <em>Y is hot</em>, but rather <em>X has less temperature</em> and <em>Y has greater temperature</em>. Similarly, one does not say <em>A is 
    near to me</em> and <em>B is far from me,</em> but rather <em>the distance from 
      me to A </em>(or proximity of A to me)<em> is less than the distance from me 
        to B</em> (or proximity of B to me). Note that the choice of translation for 
  the latter stem as either &#8216;distance&#8217; or &#8216;proximity&#8217; 
  becomes arbitrary, as the real meaning of the Ithkuil formative is &#8216;amount 
  of linear space separating one party from another.&#8217; Virtually all Western 
  descriptive and dimensional oppositions are similarly handled in Ithkuil as 
  mere variance in the quantity of a single quality, the degree of an attribute, 
  or the extent along a spatio-temporal range or continuum.</p>

  <tr>
    <td><div><font size="4"><strong>10.3 SPATIAL POSITION AND ORIENTATION</strong></font></div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Concepts of spatial position and orientation are expressed 
  very differently in Ithkuil as compared to Western languages such as English. 
  The three major differences are explained below, each of which will be explored 
  in detail in the sections which follow.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">1) Ithkuil does not employ prepositions; all notions of spatial 
  relationships, position, and orientation are designated by nominal/verbal formatives.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">2) While Western languages allow spatial/positional reference 
  to function autonomously irrespective of the speaker&#8217;s cognitive or semantic 
  intent, Ithkuil subordinates spatial/positional reference at the lexico-semantic 
  level in deference to the cognitive or semantic purpose of an utterance. What 
  this means is that sentences describing spatial relationships or positional 
  reference are only used when the underlying intent of the speaker&#8217;s utterance 
  is purely to specify spatial or positional reference information. If, in fact, 
  the underlying intent of the utterance is to show some functional or purposeful 
  relationship (where a spatial relationship is merely coincidental or consequential), 
  the Ithkuil sentence will describe this function or purpose, not the spatial 
  relationship. For example, in answer to the question <em>Where&#8217;s Billy?</em> an English speaker might give answers such as (a) <em>He&#8217;s standing right 
    next to Sam</em>, or (b) <em>He&#8217;s in bed</em>, or (c) <em>He&#8217;s in 
      the bathtub</em>. While each of these sentences gives spatial information, only 
  the first is truly intended to convey spatial information as its purpose, while 
  sentences (b) and (c) imply information that is, in fact, more relevant than 
  the spatial information given, e.g., sentence (b) could be restated as &#8216;He&#8217;s 
  sleeping (or sick),&#8217; while sentence (c) could be restated as &#8216;He&#8217;s 
  bathing.&#8217; An Ithkuil speaker would not utter sentences like (b) or (c) 
  in answer to the query about Billy, since he/she would assume the question <em>Where&#8217;s 
    Billy?</em> is intended to inquire only about Billy&#8217;s physical position 
  in absolute space. If the questioner had, in fact, been seeking non-spatial 
  information, he/she would have asked the Ithkuil equivalent of <em>What&#8217;s 
    Billy doing?</em> or <em>What&#8217;s happening with Billy?</em> to which a 
  Ithkuil speaker would answer with sentences corresponding to the rephrased versions 
  of (b) or (c), not their original versions.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">3) Ithkuil utilizes an absolute coordinate system of comparative 
  spacial reference, not a relative one as found in most languages. Note the positional 
  ambiguity inherent in sentences such as <em>He&#8217;s standing to the left 
    of the desk</em>. To be meaningful, the listener must first determine from whose 
  perspective the speaker is referring (i.e., do we mean the speaker&#8217;s left, 
  the addressee&#8217;s left, the desk&#8217;s left relative to the position of 
  the speaker, the desk&#8217;s left relative to the position of the addressee, 
  or the desk&#8217;s left relative to the direction the desk is oriented/facing?) 
  Such ambiguity occurs because Western languages employ a relative coordinate 
  system which can shift from one participant or referent object to another. Ithkuil 
  spatial reference employs an absolute coordinate system independent of the perspective 
  of a participant (e.g., the speaker or addressee) or referent object (i.e., 
  the thing(s) whose position is being described), as opposed to the relative 
  coordinate system found in Western languages. The Ithkuil system allows listeners 
  to understand exactly the spatial relationship and orientation of any object(s) 
  in absolute space, irrespective of anyone&#8217;s (or anything&#8217;s) personal 
  perspective. </p>
<h3 align="justify"><br />
  10.3.1 Formatives vs. Prepositions</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Besides lexically &#8220;partitioning&#8221; the world of two- 
  and three-dimensional space in different ways than in Western languages, Ithkuil 
  has no prepositions. Rather, Ithkuil utilizes formatives which describe a spatial 
  relationship between two objects or between an object and an associated background, 
  the nearest translations being a noun meaning &#8220;the area X&#8221; or a 
  verb meaning &#8220;to be positioned X&#8221;, where X corresponds to a Western 
  preposition or positional adverb such as &#8220;in&#8221; or &#8220;inside.&#8221;</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify"> 10.3.2 Underlying Cognitive Purpose of an Utterance</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Ithkuil grammar considers the functional relationship between 
  two objects to be primarily relevant, not their spatial orientation or position 
  relative to each other (or between an object and its background). When it comes 
  to describing an object against a background or the relationship between two 
  objects, Ithkuil grammar is more interested in answering the question <em>How 
    do X and Y function relative to each other</em>, rather than <em>How are X and 
      Y positioned in space relative to each other?</em> </p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">For example: in uttering the English sentence <em>The vase 
  is on the table</em>, is the intention of the sentence to tell the listener 
  the physical coordinate position of the vase in 3-D space relative to the table, 
  or to tell the listener that the vase is being physically supported (i.e., against 
  gravity) by the table? If the intention is the former, the corresponding Ithkuil 
  sentence would indeed utilize a spatial formative translatable as &#8216;manifest 
  self on the top side of a surface that is horizontal relative to the direction 
  of gravity.&#8217; However, if the intention is to actually indicate support 
  against gravity, the Ithkuil sentence would not utilize a spatial reference 
  at all, but rather translate the sentence more or less as <em>The table is supporting 
    the vase</em>. As a result, spatial, locative, or orientational formatives in 
  Ithkuil are used far less often than corresponding prepositions and spatial 
  constructions in English or other Western languages. Note the following examples 
  illustrating how various English sentences utilizing the concept &#8216;in&#8217; 
  (meaning &#8216;inside&#8217; or &#8216;into&#8217;) are translated into Ithkuil 
  using various non-spatial roots based on reason or purpose.</p>

  </span></font><span class="style10"> This functional prioritization notwithstanding, Ithkuil is nevertheless 
  able, if necessary, to describe true spatial relationships and orientations 
  quite specifically. However, it does so in ways that are very unfamiliar in 
  terms of Western grammar. These are described in the following section.</span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><a name="Sec10o3o3" id="Sec10o3o3"></a><br />
  10.3.3 Absolute vs. Relative Spatial/Positional Coordinates</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">While Western languages are capable of describing the physical 
  position and orientation of object in absolute terms (e.g., <em>My hometown 
    is located at 93&deg;41'36&quot;W by 43&deg;12'55&quot;N</em>), it is not normal 
  to do so in general parlance. Rather, Western spatial position and orientation 
  is normally relative, i.e., described from the dynamic perspective of the two 
  objects themselves or from the perspective of a third party observer (usually, 
  but not exclusively, the speaker). Therefore, if I describe the position of 
  objects in my backyard to you on the telephone, and you have never seen my backyard, 
  phrases such as &#8216;the swingset is against the wall,&#8217; &#8216;the barbecue 
  is sitting to my right,&#8217; &#8216;the elm tree is behind the shed&#8217; 
  and &#8216;the rose bush is beyond the bird fountain&#8217; convey little information 
  without first having to establish a common frame of reference based on where 
  the speaker is positioned relative to the edges of the yard (in order to interpret 
  what he means by &#8216;beyond the fountain&#8217;), which way he is facing 
  relative to the yard (in order to interpret what he means by &#8216;to my right&#8217;), 
  perhaps even the orientation of the shape of the yard relative to some external 
  absolute system of orientation (e.g., the four cardinal directions N, S, E, 
  W).</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">In such a relative scheme concepts such as &#8216;to my right&#8217; 
  change completely if I turn my body 180 degrees. Confusion also occurs when 
  I say &#8216;to the left of the chair.&#8217; Do I mean to the left side of 
  the chair from my (the speaker&#8217;s) perspective? Or do I mean to the left 
  side of the chair from the perspective of someone sitting in the chair?</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Ithkuil avoids such confusions by being based on an absolute 
  coordinate system of spatial reference as opposed to a relative system (similar 
  in nature to the absolute system used in navigation based on the four cardinal 
  points.). Very few languages on Earth utilize such absolute systems to the exclusion 
  of relative systems. (Examples include Guugu Yimidhirr, an Australian aboriginal 
  language; Tzeltal, a Yucatec Mayan language; and Yurok, an Algonquian Indian 
  language of Northern California). Ithkuil utilizes three different absolute 
  coordinate schemes, each functioning within a different speech context. These 
  coordinate systems establish a three-dimensional right-angled coordinate grid 
  superimposed upon space, with the X-axis reckoned from a line perpendicular 
  to the direction of gravity (which, for practical purposes, we may term &#8220;horizontal&#8221;), 
  the Z-axis reckoned by a line corresponding to the direction of gravity (which 
  may be termed the &#8220;vertical&#8221;) and the all-important Y-axis (which 
  differentiates a relative system from an absolute) derived from one of three 
  points of reckoning depending on which coordinate scheme is being utilized. 
  The three schemes are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">1) <strong>Solar-based system</strong>. This is the standard 
  Ithkuil system of reckoning. The line of the Y-axis runs parallel to the rising 
  and setting points of the sun in mid-summer, with the vector oriented in the 
  direction of the setting sun. Note that the alignment of this Y-axis relative 
  to the X-axis is variable; i.e., the line connecting the rising and setting 
  points of the sun merely designate the <em>direction</em> of the Y-axis, not 
  it actual position. This is necessary so that descriptions of spatial relationships 
  can be made using a &#8220;octant locator&#8221; system based on this grid, 
  where any two objects can be made to lie within different octants relative 
  to each other (this will be illustrated below). </p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Use of this solar-based reckoning system continues at nighttime 
  and on overcast or rainy days, based on society&#8217;s collective knowledge 
  and/or recollection of landmarks indicating the rising and setting points of 
  the sun. Use of this system even continues indoors if there exists a collective 
  understanding of the orientation of the building/structure/room relative to 
  the solar-based Y-axis (i.e., everyone in the room can still tell the orientation 
  of the outdoor Y-axis, whether by sight through windows, or by noticing that 
  the length-width ratios of the room are aligned with the outdoor Y-axis).</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">2) <strong>Length vs. width of enclosed space or room</strong>. 
  In indoor situations where the orientation of the outdoor solar-based Y-axis 
  is unknown (or cannot be readily determined on a continuous basis as new speakers 
  enter the room), an arbitrary Y-axis is connoted by the length of the room in 
  a direction away from whichever end of the room displays a visibly unique feature 
  (e.g., the doorway, a window, an alcove, an imposing piece of furniture, a stage 
  or dais, etc.), this symbolically substituting for the position of the rising 
  sun. This is the coordinate system which would be employed in theaters, enclosed 
  banquet halls without windows, and cellars without windows or ready access to 
  outside orientation.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">3) <strong>Arbitrarily delineated axis based on local landmarks, 
  objects, or persons</strong>. This is similar to a Western relative system in 
  which the speaker announces the orientation perspective being utilized. An Ithkuil 
  speaker would consider this a highly unusual and &#8220;affected&#8221; method 
  of reckoning. Nevertheless, it is possible to designate a personally defined 
  reckoning system using words to designate the origin point and direction of 
  the Y-axis vector, examples translatable by such phrases as &#8216;based on 
  a vector from me to that large window&#8217; or &#8216;based on a vector between 
  the shed and the big oak tree.&#8217; In fact, this is the purpose of the NAVIGATIVE case (see <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o7o6">Sec. 4.7.6</a>). 
  The primary use for this system of reckoning is literary or narrative, such 
  as when a speaker tells a story of another time and place, in which he/she wishes 
  to describe spatial relationships solely within the context of the story in 
  order to convey a mental map or image of the goings-on to his/her audience.</p>

  Using such a triaxial three-dimensional grid, Ithkuil then lexically divides 
  up space into &#8220;octants&#8221;, four quadrants to each given &#8220;hemisphere&#8221; 
  of absolute space delineated by the three axes, for a total of eight octants.</p>

  <span class="style10">It is the ability to &#8220;slide&#8221; the axes of this three-dimensional 
  grid that allows Ithkuil to easily describe the relative position of objects 
  in an absolute manner. Because the grid can be arranged so that any two objects 
  each fall into different octants, a series of octant-to-octant relationships 
  between the two objects can be lexified. Thus, each of the above roots has a 
  stem which, in conjunction with a set of affixes, designates a spatial relationship 
  between an object occupying that octant and a second object occupying any 
  of the seven other octants. For the purpose of this analysis, we will call 
  each of these octant-to-octant static relationships a &#8220;positional 
  frame.&#8221; (the leftover affixes refer to (1) 1st object in motion while 
  2nd object at rest, and (2) 2nd object in motion while first object at rest. 
  Used to mark the participant nouns with motion sentences described below.) </span></p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Additionally, such a positional reference system allows a speaker 
  to describe exactly the spatial relationships between two objects in motion relative 
  to each other. This is done in Ithkuil by stating that two object are moving 
  from positional frame A toward positional frame B. If one remembers that, by 
  &#8220;positional frame&#8221; we mean a spatial relationship between two objects, 
  not a specific location in space, it can be seen how such a simple formula easily 
  describes the relative trajectories of two objects. An Ithkuil speaker is describing 
  exactly how two objects are moving through space by stating in one short sentence 
  the octant-to-octant relationship the two objects have to start with, and 
  the octant-to-octant relationship they will have when the motion is ended. 
  The root used to describe the motion indicates the nature of the motion in terms 
  of its smoothness, speed, etc.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">To insert a third party into a positional frame (such as describing 
  where the speaker or addressee or third party is situated relative to the two 
  objects described in the positional frame) a case-frame clause is added to the 
  sentence in the concursive case (&#8220;while/during/at the time of&#8221;) 
  which states the positional frame between that third party and the FIRST party 
  (unless the 2nd party is overtly specified). Example: &#8220;The dog and the 
  ball M&#8217;d while the cat N&#8217;d,&#8221; where M is the positional frame 
  of the dog and ball and N is the positional frame between the cat and dog.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style10">Based on the above, we can see just how exact Ithkuil can be 
  in describing relative position between objects in an absolute manner. This 
  is best illustrated by narrowly translating into English an Ithkuil sentence 
  which describes a three-party positional situation.</span><br />

</table>
<p align="justify" class="style10">In a word-for-word comparison to a Eurocentric vocabulary, 
  especially one as large as that of English, the Ithkuil lexicon appears very 
  overgeneralized in many respects. At first impression, it appears that shades 
  of meaning expressed by multiple words in English are expressed by only one 
  root in Ithkuil. As we have seen repeatedly throughout this work, this is primarily 
  due to the fact that shades of meaning for a single underlying cognitive concept 
  are normally differentiated at the morphological level in Ithkuil, as opposed 
  to the lexical. Nevertheless, there are several lexico-semantic areas where 
  Ithkuil truly does generalize in comparison to Western languages. This occurs 
  primarily where (1) Western vocabulary distinguishes separate lexemes for a 
  redundant concept based on different participants to, practitioners of, or manifestations 
  of that concept, and (2) where lexification is at an arbitrarily detailed or 
  particularized level. These topics are discussed in detail in the following 
  sections.</p>
<h3 align="justify"><br />
  10.4.1 Consolidation of Unnecessary Distinctions</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">As an example of lexical generalization in Ithkuil (or over-lexicalization 
  in English!), compare the following words for animal vocal sounds: <em>meow, 
    bark, whinny, chirp, moo, bray</em>, etc. Each of these words mean merely to 
  make one&#8217;s species-specific inherent vocal sound. Ithkuil utilizes only 
  a single stem for this concept (essentially meaning <em>vocal sound/vocalize</em> &#8211; from the same root which gives the stem for <em>(human) voice</em>), 
  based on the logical assumption that, since cats can&#8217;t bark, whinny or 
  moo, and dogs can&#8217;t meow, whinny or moo, there is no need to differentiate 
  lexically the innate vocal sound being made by an animal if the animal making 
  the sound is identified in the sentence. Of course, one might argue that English 
  allows for metaphorical or similative application of such words, as in <em>The 
    sergeant barked out orders to the platoon</em>, or <em>The baby squealed in 
      delight.</em> Such constructions are perfectly captured in Ithkuil via the <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o5o9">ESSIVE</a> and <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o5o10">ASSIMILATIVE</a> cases, as in <em>He &#8216;vocalized&#8217; the orders like a dog</em>, or <em>The 
        baby &#8216;vocalized&#8217; like a baby piglet from feeling delight,</em> or 
via the manipulation of Function, Incorporation and Format (see <a href="05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o1">Sections 5.1</a> and <a href="06_verbs_2.html#Sec6o4">6.4</a>).</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Similar series of English words which reduce to a single stem 
  in Ithkuil would be (1) <em>herd, flock, pride, gaggle</em>, etc.; (2) <em>hair, 
    fur, fleece, coat</em>, etc.; (3) <em>skin, hide, pelt, pellicle, peel, rind, 
      lambskin, leather, integument</em>, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify"> 10.4.2 Translative Motion, Paths and Trajectories</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">By translative motion is meant the idea of an object moving 
  (or being moved) from one location to another. English is particularly rich 
  in its vocabulary to describe the various paths or trajectories of such an object, 
  not only in regard to the &#8220;shape&#8221; or form of the path or trajectory, 
  but also the means of initiating the movement. Thus we have terms such as <em>to 
    toss, throw, pitch, hurl, fling, roll, run</em>, or <em>pass</em> a ball or 
  other object. In reaching its destination, the object can <em>fly, float, wing, 
    pass, arc, sail, plummet, drop, fall, thread, hop, leap, bounce, roll, zig-zag, 
    slide, glide, slither</em>, or <em>jump</em> its way there.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">As we have seen to be the case in other contexts, Ithkuil lexifies 
  concepts of translative motion with a focus on the contexts of purpose and outcome, 
  not on the &#8220;innate structure&#8221; of the event as an end in itself. 
  Essentially, Ithkuil is less concerned with how the object gets there and is 
  more concerned about why it&#8217;s going there and whether it arrives. For 
  example, look at the following two columns of English sentences :</p>
<div align="justify"><br />
  <table width="65%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
    <tr>
      <td width="55%"><blockquote class="style10">
        <p><em>I tossed it into 
          the basket.</em></p>
      </blockquote></td>
      <td width="45%"><span class="style10"><em>It sailed 
        into the basket.</em></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote class="style10">
        <p><em>I flung it into the 
          basket.</em></p>
      </blockquote></td>
      <td><span class="style10"><em>It flew into the basket.</em></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote class="style10">
        <p><em>I hurled it into 
          the basket.</em></p>
      </blockquote></td>
      <td><span class="style10"><em>It arced its way into 
        the basket.</em></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote class="style10">
        <p><em>I pitched it into 
          the basket.</em></p>
      </blockquote></td>
      <td><span class="style10"><em>It fell into the basket.</em></span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"><br />
  </font><span class="style10">The sentences in the lefthand column 
  describes how I initiate the action while those in the righthand column describe 
  how the object moves. In Ithkuil the lefthand column of sentences would normally 
  all be translated by a single sentence narrowly translatable as <em>I made it 
    end up inside the basket</em>, while the righthand column of sentences would 
  all be translated by the exact same sentence minus the <a href="04_case.html#Sec4o3o4">ERGATIVE</a> personal referent <em>I</em>, thus: <em>It ended up inside the basket</em>.</span></p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">So where are the words translating the range of descriptive 
  nuance surrounding the means of sending it into the basket and the different 
  trajectories it takes there? In normal Ithkuil speech, such distinctions would 
  be considered irrelevant. This is because Ithkuil grammar questions all acts, 
  conditions and events as to their underlying cognitive purpose. For the above 
  sentences, Ithkuil views them as all having the same underlying purpose: to 
  express that I have caused an object to pass from a state of being in my alienable 
  possession to a state of being within the basket, by passing through the physical 
  space between me and the basket. Therefore there is only one translation for 
  the varying sentence pairs.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Before the reader begins to think that Ithkuil is incapable 
  of distinguishing the shades of meaning present in the above examples, it should 
  be noted that such distinctions can be easily rendered by additional affixes 
  and words describing these concepts. For example, if it is truly necessary to 
  indicate that the object was &#8220;flung&#8221; into the basket, Ithkuil can 
  augment the sentence <em>I made it end up inside the basket</em> to include 
  affixes which indicate use of the hand in a sudden recoil-like motion plus affixes 
  indicating forceful and rapid arrival into the basket, the result being narrowly 
  translatable as <em>Using my hand in a sudden, subtle, recoil-like motion I 
    caused it to move quickly away and end up forcefully inside the basket</em>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">While this would more or less accurately capture the nuances 
  of English &#8220;flung,&#8221; Ithkuil first makes us stop and ask ourselves, 
  why is it even necessary to describe the details of the trajectory and the force 
  initiating it? After all, in a normal everyday contextual setting, if an English 
  speaker were to use the verb &#8220;tossed&#8221; or &#8220;threw&#8221; or 
  &#8220;placed&#8221; or &#8220;put&#8221; instead of &#8220;flung&#8221; in 
  the above sentence, would his/her speaker be considered to have been given information 
  any less sufficient or essential for understanding the message and its purpose? 
  All of which again illustrates the dynamism of Ithkuil lexico-semantics: if 
  a complex, highly detailed morphology already conveys a high degree of semantic 
  and cognitive nuance, why belabor the obvious by reinforcing such nuances at 
  the lexical level if the context and underlying cognitive purpose of the utterance 
  does not require it? Thus the Ithkuil language not only captures levels of cognitive 
  detail beyond the scope of Western languages, but it also allows the speaker 
  to avoid having to provide such detail when it is inessential.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify"> 10.4.3 No Lexification of Specific Instances of Underlying 
  Processes</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">In regard to over-lexification in English from a Ithkuil perspective, 
  an example would be <em>limp</em>, as in &#8216;to walk with a limp.&#8217; 
  Ithkuil recognizes that, in observing a person walking with a limp, it is not 
  the condition <em>per se</em> that is relevant, but rather the manner in which 
  the condition causes the person to move, i.e. asymmetrically, irregularly, discontinuously 
  in an unexpected way inconsistent with a &#8220;normal&#8221; or &#8220;standard&#8221; 
  expectation of walking. Ithkuil speakers would consider English <em>limp</em> to represent an arbitrarily specific occurrence of an underlying state of translative 
  movement. To a Ithkuil speaker, what is important is the way the person moves. 
  The idea that a person continues to &#8220;have a limp&#8221; even when sleeping 
  or sitting is considered absurd. What the person &#8220;continues to have&#8221; 
  is an underlying physical injury, abnormality, disability, illness, or deformity 
  which causes the person to move asymmetrically when walking. Therefore, instead 
  of <em>He has a limp because of his war wound,</em> a Ithkuil speaker would 
  say <em>He walks asymmetrically/irregularly because of his war wound</em>. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">To illustrate this by analogy, consider a person who, when 
  dancing to rock music, has a tendency to jerk his/her head to the left at the 
  sound of the downbeat. Most English speakers would consider it ludicrous over-lexicalization 
  to propose a verb &#8220;spreggle&#8221; meaning &#8216;to jerk one&#8217;s 
  head to the left on the downbeat when dancing,&#8217; as in the hypothetical 
  sentence <em>She spreggles to rock music</em>. Yet, from the Ithkuil standpoint, 
  there is no difference in arbitrariness between the hypothetical &#8220;spreggle&#8221; 
  and the actual word &#8216;limp.&#8217;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Based on a combination of the above reasoning surrounding both 
  animal vocal sounds and &#8216;limp,&#8217; Ithkuil has no words for &#8216;blind(ness),&#8217; 
  &#8216;deaf(ness),&#8217; &#8216;mute(ness),&#8217; &#8216;dementia,&#8217; 
  or &#8216;paralysis.&#8217; In Ithkuil, one simply says <em>He can&#8217;t see, 
    She can&#8217;t hear, She can&#8217;t speak, He can&#8217;t think, He can&#8217;t 
    move</em>, or alternately <em>His faculty of sight </em>(or other sense or innate 
  faculty)<em> doesn&#8217;t function/no longer functions</em>. [Note: each of 
  these sentences would, of course, employ appropriate morphological markers, 
  case, voice, degrees of affixes, etc. to indicate the extent of functional loss, 
  whether temporary or permanent, whether increasing or decreasing, whether externally 
  caused or inherently developed, etc.]</p>

</table>
<p align="justify" class="style10">While we have examined the many ways in which the dynamism 
  and logic of Ithkuil grammar eliminates whole swaths of equivalent English vocabulary, 
  there are, nevertheless, many concepts where Ithkuil provides autonomous lexical 
  roots and stems for which neither English nor other Western languages provide 
  similar words and must resort to paraphrase in order to translate. Such concepts 
  are particularly found in the realm of human emotions, social relationships, 
  functional interrelationships between objects, philosophy, psychology, and sensory 
  phenomena. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Underlying such differentiation is the idea that the Ithkuil 
  language is meant to reflect in linguistic terms as close a representation of 
  human cognition and pre-linguistic epistemological categorization as is possible 
  in language without resorting to outright linguistic representations of pure 
  mathematical logic. Since the inner mental life of the speaker is often clouded 
  in vagueness or artificial &#8220;surface&#8221; categories once represented 
  in spoken languages such as English and other Eurocentric languages, a language 
  which is focused on representing that inner mental life will necessarily require 
  many more words to describe that life than are commonly available in existing 
  human languages. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style10">Western languages have several words and/or concepts for which 
  there is no exactly corresponding equivalent in Ithkuil. These include the concepts 
  embodied in the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; and &#8220;to have.&#8221; Ithkuil 
  has no way of truly expressing copula identification corresponding to &#8220;be&#8221; 
  or &#8220;being&#8221;, nor any direct translation of possession or ownership 
  equivalent to &#8220;have.&#8221; Essentially this is because Ithkuil grammar 
  and lexico-semantics do not recognize inherent existential identification or 
  inherent existential possession as true semantic functional categories or fundamental 
  cognitive primitives.</p>
<h3 align="justify"><br />
  10.6.1 Translating &#8220;To Be&#8221;</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Ithkuil grammar inherently recognizes that the universe is, 
  at any and all moments, and on all scales large and small, in a state of flux. 
  The idea that any given entity can be permanently or innately identified as 
  &#8220;being&#8221; some other entity is considered nonsensical. Ithkuil grammar 
  has no way of clearly indicating any such notions as &#8220;being&#8221; or 
  &#8220;to be,&#8221; as the universe is a universe of actions or states that 
  are the results of actions. Even states, as such, are in flux and different 
  from moment to moment, if only because the mere passage of time itself renders 
  the &#8220;static&#8221; condition different than it was the moment before. 
  Therefore, one cannot &#8220;be&#8221; anything else, or for that matter &#8220;be&#8221; 
  anything at all. Rather, one &#8220;does&#8221; or &#8220;functions as&#8221; 
  or &#8220;fulfills a role as&#8221; or &#8220;manifests itself as&#8221; something 
  else. Fundamental to Ithkuil grammar are the notions of function and purpose, 
  not mere description; results, not mere means; manifestation, not mere existence. 
  This explains why there is no true distinction between nouns and verbs in Ithkuil, 
  both being mere differences in functional roles played by any given formative 
  concept whose underlying meaning is not inherently nominal or verbal, but rather 
  a conceptual primitive waiting to be manifested as either (1) a representation 
  of an action, process, or event, (i.e., a verb), or (2) as a concrete or abstract 
  entity that is representative of, or embodies the underlying concept (i.e., 
  a noun).</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10">So, an Ithkuil speaker does not say <em>I am John, She is a 
  cook, The leaf is green, Stan is ill,</em> or <em>Murder is wrong,</em> but 
  rather <em>One calls me John, She cooks [for a living], The leaf [currently] 
    manifests a green color, Stan feels ill [or carries a disease],</em> and <em>Murder 
      controverts morality</em>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style10 style10">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style10">10.6.2 Translating &#8216;To Have&#8217;</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">In regard to &#8220;have&#8221; or &#8220;having,&#8221; Ithkuil 
  views the concept of possession as breaking down into more specific functional 
  states and categories, each operating independently and having little relation 
  to each other. The neutral, default way of expressing &#8220;to have&#8221; involves placing the possessor in the DATIVE case and utilizing the MANIFESTIVE function of the verb, so that the phrase <em>&#8220;I have a book&#8221;</em> translates more or less as <em>&#8220;There is a book to me.&#8221;</em><br />
</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style10">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 align="justify" class="style10"> 10.6.3 &#8216;Yes,&#8217; &#8216;No&#8217; and Other Interjections</h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">As there are no interjections in Ithkuil, there are no true 
  equivalents to &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; in Ithkuil. Nevertheless,  Ithkuil grammar also allows for the use of Bias suffixes (see <a href="05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o11">Sec. 5.11</a>) to function 
  as autonomous words to convey attitudes and emotional responses similarly to 
  interjections in Western languages. This phenomenon has already been discussed 
  in <a href="08_adjuncts.html#Sec8o4">Section 8.4</a>. 
  Additionally, <a href="08_adjuncts.html#Sec8o3">Section 
    8.3</a> described how affixual adjuncts may be used to convey information similarly 
  to autonomous interjections.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>10.6.4  &ldquo;WH&rdquo;-Questions</h3>
<p class="style10">Ithkuil has no equivalent to WH-question words such  as <em>what? where? when? why? how?</em> etc.&nbsp;  Instead, statements are made using DIRECTIVE illocution (and hopefully SOLICITIVE bias) to provide the  desired information.&nbsp; Thus, instead of  asking &ldquo;Where is the toilet?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; one says &ldquo;Please state the  toilet&rsquo;s location&rdquo; and &ldquo;Please identify yourself.&rdquo; </p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style10">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 align="justify" class="style10">  10.6.5 Translating Metaphorically Structured Phrases </h3>
<p align="justify" class="style10">Ithkuil grammar recognizes that much of our understanding and 
  expression of everyday experience is structured in terms of metaphor and metonymy 
  (the latter being the reference to an entity by one of its attributes, associations 
  or activities, as in <em><strong>The ham-and-cheese</strong> wants fries with 
    his order</em> or <em><strong>The White House</strong> has its nose in our business</em>). 
  Ithkuil allows for the overt designation of metaphorical concepts by several 
  means. These include the <a href="03_morphology.html#Sec3o6o3">REPRESENTATIONAL</a> context, stem <a href="06_verbs_2.html#Sec6o4">incorporation</a>, 
  the <a href="07_suffixes.html#METsuffix">metonymic MET </a> affix 
  -<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>qt</strong></font>, 
  and the two <a href="07_suffixes.html#PTFsuffix">part-whole 
    PTF and PTG suffixes</a> -<span class="style36">rs</span> and -<span class="style36">&#353;</span>.</p>
